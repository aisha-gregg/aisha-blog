        One of the most valuable things in my life is to be able to go where my
        heart leads, in order to discover something new and life changing. In
        May,I discovered the country of Morocco in all its splender, poverty and
        culture. I travelled from Madrid to Fez on Tuesday the 30th of April. It
        was a beautiful warm evening.I remember landing and my first thought was
        "Wow, IÂ´m in Africa!" The sun caressed my skin as I walked contently off
        the plane and towards security.<br /><br />I remember thinking how much
        the airport reminded me of small airports in the caribbean, even the one
        in my home country in Tobago. Getting through security took awhile and I
        must say they are very strict with travellers, especially if you need a
        visa like I did prepare to wait about 20 minutes or more to get through.
        Finally outside, we took a taxi to our Airbnb.And from this point the
        flood of similarities between my country and morocco began.First of all
        traffic is crazy and the people drive quickly.Lack of pedestrian walks
        meant there were people running into the street left right and center in
        order to evade oncoming traffic. When we safely arrived to our airbnb we
        were greeted by a lovely italian guy and his wife.The apartment was the
        highest floor with beautiful views of the Fez mountains.
