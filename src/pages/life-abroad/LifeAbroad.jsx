      <h3> Life Abroad</h3> Sometimes it is so interesting the differences you
      see from country to country, especially when you have to live it daily.
      The day I left the caribbean sometimes repeats in my mind and I remember
      the anxiety and fear I faced.I wondered if I was making the right decision
      because it definitely takes balls to leave it all behind. For all it is
      worth I continue to view it as a very rewarding experience.The
      independence you gain is uncomparable to the kind of independence you had
      before and you learn so much about yourself.However there are always
      things that struggle to fill that gap felt in your heart.Sometimes I would
      walk by restaurants and miss the flavourful food of my country. Actually,
      let´s start here...
      <ul>
        <strong> 1.Food</strong>
        <p>
          One big difference is the local food here. It is fine but coming from
          a palate that is used to alot of flavour and spice it can be
          underwhelming at times.The dishes of my country usually have some
          indian influence and I found that the local plates like paella, fries
          and egg and croquetas were not as amazing as many tourists claimed.A
          sunny side up runny egg is also a big thing here, which honestly I
          still don´t get lol. I did eventually have the opportunity to have
          homemade paella and it was amazing.A lot of the food here grew on me
          though and I enjoy it now ...thankfully.
        </p>
        <strong>2.Weather</strong>
        <p>
          I do not like the cold. In fact, I am one they would call "friolera"
          here.( Sommeone who always feels cold) Of course, coming from the
          caribbean people always ask me why I came to Europe. What was I
          thinking? I sometimes reflect on it, especially in the winter.But the
          truth is the winters here are not THAT bad and we are not bombarded by
          snow.It is usually moderate.The most troublesome thing is not having a
          wadrobe big enough to have winter and summer clothes sections and
          having to retire your summer clothes in a suitcase in order to revive
          your winter jackets, scarfs and boots...Not that fun.I remember always
          having to check the weather app before I left the house too.Feeling
          cold in your home and not having sufficient heating to sleep.Also not
          fun lol. The summers here are hot and sticky.But I still prefer it
          over winter.I can wear almost anything I want.Dont really need to
          depend on the weather app too much and I am apparently so much
          lighter.But yes suncreen, suncreen suncreen.Very important!Because
          that sun will burn you alive here and there are barely any clouds
          during the hot summer months!
        </p>
        <strong>3.Culture</strong>{" "}
        <p>
          Everyone is always out even on weekdays.It is always a social scene, I
          would have to say even more than my own country and we do love a party
          there.It is super commom to see a lot of people having drinks after
          work ANY DAY of the week and yes that means even on Monday.I suppose
          older people with kids not so much but you may even see a small child
          at 10pm on a Wednesday in a restaurant type bar with their parents
          while they have a drink and meal.
        </p>
        <strong>4.Racism</strong>{" "}
        <p>
          So this is a topic I have heard about in certain countries in Europe
          and Spain is no exception.However, I would have to say I am lucky to
          be living in a big city with many cultural influences and ethnicities
          and I have not seen many cases of racism.I would share however, times
          when I felt a little isolated and discriminated against, racism even;
          for example a lady not sitting next to me on the underground ... but
          that may be a topic for another blog or vlog.
        </p>
        <strong>5.Language Barriers </strong>
        <p>
          It feels nice to feel like you fit in somewhere and
          belong.However,some
        </p>
        Some say curisosity kills the cat but what if curiosity makes you alive
        once again?
      </ul>
    </main>
