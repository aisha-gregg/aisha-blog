## Venice

The beautiful Italian city of 150 canals built across 100 islands is a treasure to both the young and old. On a beautiful sunny day in May I was fortunate to visit with some friends and discovered for the second time why they call it the floating city. The first time you walk out of the station and cast your eyes on Venice, you might as well believe you've just visited a land straight out of a fantasy world. It will take your breath away as you stand in awe at the canals, bridges and maze like roads that disperse into the city's intricate corners.

We started our day very early, getting into Venice by train at about 8am. Starting at this time will give you the entire day to see the gorgeous floating city and even relax for a moment or two from all that walking. So take advantage, there is a lot to see!

Top things to see in Venice.

1. **The Grand Canal**

   The grand canal of Venice is the main canal that is lined by many restaurants, shops and bars. The main bridge which is seen over this canal is the Rialto bridge which rises and arcs over this canal. It is the main mode of transport for many boats and gondolas.

2. **The bridge of sighs**

   The bridge of sighs is a beautiful white limestone bridge that has bars of stones which connects to Doge's Palace. They call it the bridge of sighs because this was where many convicts would get their last view of Venice before being imprisoned for their crimes.

3. **Chiodo Bridge**

   This "Nail bridge" existed since the 1700s and is a curisously small bridge that does not have any handrails. It is the only bridge in Venice that has no sides and is a famous spot for photo taking while many people pose on the bridge for fun... perhaps it is also an adrenaline rush for many!

4. **Rialto bridge**

   This bridge is the oldest bridge that stretches over the Grand Canal and connects the areas of San Polo and San Marco. It is a monument very much used to see the lovely views of the canal and a great place for photos... once you can avoid the crowds!

5. **Doge's palace**
   
   You can walk to this palace which is now a museum, on foot, or opt to take a boat. The walk takes around 45 minutes from the station. This palace was formly the residence of a Venetian duke and his family but now houses statues and other decorative objects that were done in stone.

6. **Saint Marks Square and Basilica**

   Almost there! This square is the main feature of Venice, it is an exceptionally large and magnificent square with restaurants, markets, office buildings, libraries and the Basilica. It is known as the religious and social centre of Venice. This square will have your jaw on the floor as you gaze at the facades of marble and gold. Even more so, gazing at the Basilica will make you forget all about the pain you felt from walking the entire day!

7. **Island hopping to the islands of Murano and Burano**

   Burano is an island in the Venetian Lagoon that is very well known for its colourful houses and quiet laid-back lifestyle. Walking through this town is a great escape from the crowds of Venice and is a picture right out of a colouring book.

   Murano is an island, also in the lagoon which is known for its famous glass making factories. You can find there an assortment of glass beads, mirrors, vases and other crystal products.

Venice is one of those cities that I would say you should visit at least once in your life. The way the entire city wraps and spreads through winding mazes that both exhausts and surprises you. The way the city rests on those quiet canals. The shops of masks and costumes. The boat taxis that connect those 100 islands. The void of cars. The reflection that Venice inflicts on _you_.

It is an interesting city that functions like no other... all while being **drop dead gorgeous**.
