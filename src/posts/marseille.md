## Oh my, Marseille!

On August 3rd of last summer, I saw the blue seas of the southern french coast for the first time in my life.They were a radiant blue that went on for miles even caressing popular cities such as Cannes, Saint-Tropez and Montpellier.

We chose to embark on an adventure in the southern city of Marseille, which is one of the least expensive cities you can find there on the blue coast.It has a beautiful artistic mix of sea, city and mountains.
The first day we arrived we were able to catch a coach from the airport to the city for a fair price of 12 euro per person.All coaches charged around this fee.It then took us about 50 minutes to get to the city bus terminal.

The bus terminal sits on a hilly platform so that when you exit the main station you see pretty decent views of the city around you.You need to climb down numerous stairs (It's actually not as bad as it sounds)and from there you can catch a taxi or walk dependindg on the location of your hotel, hostel or Airbnb.

We walked for about 15 to 20 minutes to get to our airbnb .It was in a central location and honeslty very lovely.It was a duplex with beautiful french windows and very bright.It was probably the best Airbnb experience I had.
I decided while I was there in Marseille for one week I would take French classes in order to gain appreciation for another language.
