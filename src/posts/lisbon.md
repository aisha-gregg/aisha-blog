## Lisbon

"Have no expectations."

This is something I hear time and time again. Expectations can ruin you. They present you with so much veiled distraction from reality's truth.

And that is exactly what I did before heading to Lisbon, Portugal, in January of 2020. (Unknowingly, it would be one of the very last trips that I would embark on before the global pandemic led to international quarantine and lockdown.)

But I had **NO** expectations.

To tell you the truth, I did not even think Lisbon was that highly regarded as a touriist destination, which honestly can make it a little more uncomfortable _OR_ can give you a more lively holiday...depending on what feeds your travel soul. It all depends on what you are looking for. In my case, we had just rolled in the new year and I had a long weekend before I would start teaching at my school. I wanted to go on a mini-getaway, near the sea, without the rush of the airport and flights. Let's admit it...the airport process...is just a **'no'** sometimes.

So we rented a car from Sixt - a very well-known car rental company in Europe - and began our roadtrip! Driving from Madrid to Lisbon takes around 6 hours with toll bridges and close to 7 hours without. We left early morning and arrived in Lisbon around 1pm. We passed through the city of Badajoz, Spain. It was my first time seeing the city but honestly, it's not too much to see. We passed close to Evora, Portugal, which is a world heritage site. The views get greener and the landscapes more extended as you start to cross over the border. Looking up at the huge electrical road sign with the time on it, was almost magical, as we were transported back in time on entering Portugal. Because Spain's neighbouring country is an hour behind, we got to re-use that time on arriving in the city.

Some of the most impressive views you catch on entering Lisbon are those while crossing the large toll bridge that extends 1700 metres over the river Tajo! This is the Vasco da Gama bridge. You get amazing views while heading into the city of how it expands, rises, dips and floats on its gorgeous blue seabed.

I was immediately captivated. I had not imagined it would be so big, so beautiful.

The first thing we did was head close to the centre to walk and take a drink. We stumbled upon Barrio Alto which is a trendy and artistic area where young people gather and perform. Close to here, you can take a walk along the seaside and chill at some dock side restuarants. We visited one called _"Vestigius"_ where you can partake in a sea view along with your freshly brewed cafe.

So here are the best things to do in Lisbon (IMO):

1. **Visit the commerical square.**
   This huge square is the quintessential square which you can find in many european cities. It is called the square of commerce because of its function
   within Lisbon's economy. Government buildings sit within these walls and carry out main activities such as customs.

2. **Rua agusta arc.**
   This beautiful arc with clock is situated around the commercial square and is the main exit and entrance to the square. It was constructed in 1775 and destroyed. The new arc was rebuilt and finished in 1875. It is a main highlight of the square.

3. **Elevator of Santa Justa.**
   An elevator in the neighbourhood of Pombalina rises 45 meters in the air in its gothic facade. You can go for a ride free of charge and it carrries you to a terrace top where you can take in precious views of the city.![santajusta](./img/santaj.jpg)

4. **Mirador de Santa Catarina.**
   In barrio alto (uphill neighbourhood?ü§îüòÖ) you can find this lookout and catch even more breathtaking views of the city. A lot of people hang out here and it is very close to the elevator of Bica.

5. **Bica Elevator.**
   So this is the most pictured location in lisbon! Everyone takes this funicular to get from sao paulo street to the south of barrio alto. To ride it you pay around 3 euros (2.90) It is the most traditional form of communication in the city. They say it captures the old essence that is Lisbon.

6. **Tower of Belem.**
   This tower is also a very photographed monument. It was used as a fortress to protect the city from invaders and was where sailors would leave to embark on commerical trade within Europe. We could not make it to the belem tower at day but it is gloriously illuminated at nightfall.

7. **Christo Rey in Almada.** Across bridge 25 lies the pleasant nearby town of Almada which boasts of its green pastures and the Christo Rey. Honestly, I had no idea of this monument before coming to Lisbon and it made the surprise so much better. Remember, no expectations?üòâ
   It is very similar to the Christo Rey in Brazil and all I can say is... it is moving and so worth the trip.

8. **Day trip to Sintra.**
   Sintra is a beautiful mountain town located near Lisbon. You need to have a car to get there and the journey takes about 1 hour. Its national palace of pena is breathtaking! No doubt you feel like you have been swallowed up in a fairytale just gazing at it. It showcases large pastel coloured walls of yellow and red and expands an area of some 200 hectares! It was one of the main residences of the royal portuguese family. It is also a world heritage site. Surrounding the palace you can find gardens, lakes, greenhouses and more. Take a tour of the palace for 14 euros each.

   Just a side note, getting to the palace is very difficult as parking space is super limited. When you do find parking almost at the base of the mountain (like we did), you may opt to walk an hour and a half to the palace, or take a tuk tuk which costs 20 euros return trip...each.üòê Take an uber if you are short of cash. Trust me.

   So there you have it! Lisbon was definitely so much more enjoyable, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant than I would have EVER thought. It just so happened that we also went during Christmas time; lights still up, so that christmas spirit being present in such an amazing city, definitely made it a lot more exciting. I had little to no expectations and it made this trip and this city one of my favourites to date.
