## Morocco (Fez and Merzouga)

One of the most valuable things in life is to be able to go where your heart leads, in order to discover something new and life changing. In May, I discovered the country of Morocco in all of its splendor, poverty and culture. I travelled from Madrid to Fez on Tuesday the 30th of April. It was a beautiful warm evening. I remember landing and my first thought was **"Wow, I'm in Africa!"** The sun caressed my skin as I walked contently off the plane and towards security.

I remember thinking how much the airport reminded me of small airports in the caribbean, even the one in my home country in Tobago. Getting through security took awhile and I must say they are very strict with travellers. If you need a visa (like I did) prepare to wait about 30+ minutes to get through.

Finally outside, we took a taxi to our Airbnb and from this point the flood of similarities between my country and Morocco began. First of all; traffic is crazy and the people drive quickly. Lack of pedestrian walks meant there were people running into the street left right and center in order to evade oncoming traffic. Those of you living or have lived in countries with few pedestrain walks can surely imagine the chaos before my eyes.

When we safely and thankfully arrived at our Airbnb we were greeted by our lovely italian host and his wife. The apartment was on the highest floor with beautiful views of the mountains in Fez. That evening we rested and took a quick walk around the center of Fez, we ate at a restaurant which was French.

The next day we visited the medina of Fez which I must say is the least stressful one we visited (sorry Marrakech 🤷‍♀️).

It was adorned with chaotic scenery; people selling items in the streets, those narrow claustrophobic streets which made it impossible for four persons to pass at a time... There were stalls with vendors selling jewelry, cloth and souvenirs.

We stopped to enjoy the sweet desserts they make there which are called Chebakia. They are sesame like cookies fried and dipped in honey. You will love it if you have quite a generous sweet tooth!

Fez with its warm climate and relatively open streets, I liked. Some great attractions which I 100% recommend are:

1. **Jnan sbil Garden:** It's located 15 minutes outside the Fez medina and showcases one of the more tranquil parts of the city where you can sit or take an evening stroll.
2. **Place Boujloud, Bab Chems and Bab Mahrouk:** There is a square which is located close to the Jnan sbil gardens where you can find moroccan walls and a small square. To get here you can walk pass Bab Chems and through a small street market where anything from modern to traditional clothing is sold. On exiting, you will see the gates of the Bab Mahrouk; a castle-like wall structure. It's a small historic part of the town which is like the mouth of the Fez Medina.
3. **Fez Medina:** You cannot come to Morocco and not check out the Medinas. They are the oldest parts of the city and are distinguised by its narrow mazed streets.

The medina is located in the center of the city and has everything; food stalls, clothing stores, souvenirs, lamp fixtures, electronics and household items. In fact, right before entering the medina there was a small disorgazined market covered by tents and plastic and it definitely brought me back that nostalgic feeling of saturday morning markets in my country.

4. **Chouara Tannery:** If you are into traditional culture, you can check out the tannery where they manually soak and tint leather in order to produce the variety of leather products that they sell.

Fez was nice. And although the mazes of the city can make you feel claustrophobic it is not super chaotic. Of course it depends on when you go. I definitely recommend during the week if possible.

The most rewarding experience was coming the next day as we were going on a trip to the Sahara desert.

**THE** sahara desert.

It would take about a day to arrive so we prepared ourselves mentally for the long journey ahead. We would be driven along with two friendly guys, one from Spain and the other from Greece. Our driver Hassan took the four of us through the Swiss city of Morocco called Ifrane Province and then through the largest Oasis in Morocco before we arrived in Merzouga.

Merzouga was pretty interesting. It is basically a city made of clay and sand that sits right next to the dunes of the Sahara! We were brought to our hotel there and relaxed by the pool for about an hour before our camels and tour guides came to meet us. I found it super surprising how the hotel was so clean inside –being inside the desert and all–. I couldn't imagine living there during a sandstorm though!

Off we go!

When the Berbers came they lead us on a sunset camel ride to our overnight accomodation and full disclosure; it is ALOT more uncomfortable than you think. The camel ride is not very pleasant and can be painful for the, let's just say "derrière". The gusty winds can actually sting your face also. And while this depends on the weather conditions, just be prepared to walk with a head-scarf or what locals call "keffiyeh". I would advise for first timers to do camel rides of short distances which can be covered in a couple hours. Our camel ride was a little over an hour.

The magic of the Sahara is crossing the dunes and watching the light of the day highlight the dunes; shaping them, and even being swallowed by them, creating vast shadows. It was definitely an experience that everyone should seek once in their lifetime.

At our accomodation we were given dinner: Tanjerine of potato, carrots, chick peas and chicken. We joined along to some typical dances and also did some sand boarding, which was super fun and totally recommendable.

So before coming to Morocco I was under the impression that I would SURELY freeze to death if we slept there overnight. But... but... suprisingly the accomodation was so good! We were warm and comfortable and were fitted with a sturdy bed, lamps and three large blankets. Rugs were placed on the floor of all tents and there was also running water, bathroom stalls and sinks. It blew my mind.

The Sahara was no longer what I knew in movies and _this_ world-wonder filled with sand. It was in fact a well functioning region outfitted with electricity and water, where Berbers roamed the land and worked with tourists to earn addtional income.

I must say I had a great night's sleep especially as that night it drizzled lightly in the Sahara desert for the first time all year...

The next morning we arose at 5am to embark on our journey back to the hotel and to see the sunrise. It was a cool morning and the terrain calmer than the inital trip. Our Berber let us stop at a dune that seemed to grow towards the sky in order to take advantage of the view. We dismounted and waited for the sun.

Peaceful, is what sums up that feeling. It's like seeing the beginning of something new for the very first time. The first sunset in a place you never pictured you would be and you suddenly feel at ease. I chose to collect my memories there and then before we mounted our camels back to the hotel by gathering a bit of the Sahara that I would always have with me. This for me was the greatest souvenir.
