## Morocco (Fez and Mezouga)

One of the most valuable things in life is to be able to go where your heart leads, in order to discover something new and life changing. In May, I discovered the country of Morocco in all its splender, poverty and culture. I travelled from Madrid to Fez on Tuesday the 30th of April. It was a beautiful warm evening. I remember landing and my first thought was "Wow, I'm in Africa!" The sun caressed my skin as I walked contently off the plane and towards security.

I recall landing and my first thought being "Wow, I'm in Africa!"

I remember thinking how much the airport reminded me of small airports in the caribbean, even the one in my home country in Tobago. Getting through security took awhile and I must say they are very strict with travellers. So especially if you need a visa (like I did) prepare to wait about 30+ minutes or more to get through.

Finally outside, we took a taxi to our Airbnb and from this point the flood of similarities between my country and Morocco began.First of all; traffic is crazy and the people drive quickly.Lack of pedestrian walks meant there were people running into the street left right and center in order to evade oncoming traffic.Those of you living or have lived in countries with few pedestrain walks can surely imagine the chaos before my eyes.

When we safely and thankfully arrived at our Airbnb we were greeted by our lovely italian host and his wife.The apartment was on the highest floor with beautiful views of the mountains in Fez . That evening we rested and took a quick walk around the center of Fez, we ate at a restaurant which was French.

The next day we visited the medina of Fez which I must say is the least stressful one we visited( Sorry Marrakechü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ).
It was adorned with chaotic scenery; people selling items in the streets, those narrow claustrophobic streets which made it impossible for four persons to pass at a time... There were stalls with vendors selling jewelry ,cloth and souvenirs.

We stopped to enjoy the sweet desserts they make there which are called Chebakia. They are sesame like cookies fried and dipped in honey. You will love it if you have quite a generous sweet tooth!

Fez with it's warm climate and relatively open streets, I liked.Some great attractions which I 100% recommend are:

1. Jnan sbil Garden: It's located 15 minutes outside the Fez medina and showcases one of the more tranquil parts of the city where you can sit or take an evening stroll.
2. Place Boujloud---Bab Chems ---- Bab Mahrouk. There is a square which is located close to the Jnan sbil gardens where you can find moroccan walls and a small square.To get here you can walk pass Bab Chems and through a small street market where anything from modern to traditional clothing is sold.On exiting you will see the gates of the Bab Mahrouk; a castle like wall struture.It's a small historic part of the town which is like the mouth of the Fez Medina.

3. Fez Medina. You cannot come to Morocco and not check out the Medinas. They are the oldest parts of the city and are distinguised by its narrow mazed streets.
   The medina is located in the center of the city and has everything; food stalls, clothing stores, souvenirs, lamp fixtures, electronics and household items.In fact, right before entering the medina there was a small disorgazined market covered by tents and plastic and it definitely brought me back that nostalgic feeling of saturday morning markets in my country.
4. Chouara Tannery. If you are into traditional culture, you can check out the tannery where they manually soak and tint leather in order to produce the variety of leather products that they sell.

Fez was nice. And although the mazes of the city can make you feel claustrophobic it is not super chaotic. Of course it depends on when you go.I definiely recommend during the week if possible.

The most rewarding experience was coming the next day as we were going on a trip to the Sahara desert.

**THE** sahara desert.

It would take about a day to arrive so we prepared ourselves mentally for the long journey ahead.We would be driven along with two friendly guys, one from Spain and the other from Greece.Our driver Hassan took the four of us through the Swiss city of Morocco called Ifrane Province and then through the largest Oasis in Morocco before we arrived in Mezouga.

Mezouga was pretty interesting.It is basically a city made of clay and sand that sits right next to the Sahara! We were brought to our hotel and relaxed by the pool for about an hour before our camels and tour guides came to meet us.

Off we go!

We did a sunset camel ride to our overnight accomodation and full disclosure; it is ALOT more uncomfortable than you think.The camel ride is not very pleasant and can be painful for the, let's just say " derier".The gusty winds can actually sting your face also and while this depends on the weather conditions just be prepared to walk with a . Also I would advise for other fisrt timers camel rides of short distances which can be covered in a couple hours.Our camel ride was a little over an hour. At our accomodation we were given dinner: Tanjerine of potato, carrots, chick peas and chicken.Wejoined along to dances and also did some sand boarding,which was super fun and totally recommendable.
