## Life Abroad

Sometimes it is so interesting the differences you see from country to country, especially when you have to live it daily.
The day I left the caribbean sometimes repeats in my mind and I remember the anxiety and fear I faced.I wondered if I was making the right
decision because it definitely takes balls to leave it all behind.

For all it is worth it is a very rewarding experience.The independence you gain is uncomparable to what you knew before and you learn so much about yourself.However there are always things that struggle to fill that gap felt in your heart.Sometimes I would walk by restaurants and miss the flavourful food of my country. Actually, we can start there

1.Food

One big difference is the local food here. It is fine but coming from a pallete that is used to alot of flavour and spice it can be underwhelming at times.The dishes of my country usually have some indian influence and I found that the local plates like paella, fries and egg and croquetas were not as amazing as many tourists claimed.Although I did have the opportunity to have homemade paella and it was amazing.A lot of the food here grew on me though (eventually) and I enjoy it now thankfully.

2.Weather

I do not like the cold. In fact, I am one they would call "friolera" here.( Sommeone who always feels cold)
Of course, coming from the caribbean people always ask me why I came to Europe. I sometimes reflect on it, especially in the winter.But the truth is
the winters here are not THAT bad and we are not bombarded by snow.It is usually moderate.The most troublesome thing is not having a wadrobe big enough to have winter and summer clothes sections and having to retire your summer clothes in a suitcase in order to revive your winter jackets, scarfs and boots...Not that fun.I remember always having to check the weather app before I left the house too.Feeling cold in your home and not having sufficient heating to sleep.Also not fun lol

The summers here are hot and sticky.But I still prefer it over winter.I can wear almost anything I want.Dont really need to depend on the weather app too much and I am apparently so much lighter.But yes suncreen, suncreen suncreen.Very important!

3.Culture

Everyone is always out even on weekdays.

4.Racism and feeling outsider syndrome

5.Language Barriers

Some say curisosity kills the cat but what if curiosity makes you alive once again?
