## Life Abroad

Sometimes it is so interesting the differences you see from country to country, especially when you have to live it daily. The day I left the caribbean sometimes repeats in my mind and I remember the anxiety and fear I faced.I wondered if I was making the right decision because it definitely takes balls to leave it all behind.

For all it is worth it is a very rewarding experience.The independence you gain is uncomparable to what you knew before and you learn so much about yourself. However there are always things that struggle to fill that gap felt in your heart.Sometimes I would walk by restaurants and miss the flavourful food of my country. Actually, we can start there

### 1. Food

One big difference is the local food here. It is fine but coming from a palate that is used to alot of flavour and spice it can be underwhelming at times.The dishes of my country usually have some indian influence and I found that the local plates like paella, fries and egg and croquetas were not as amazing as many tourists claimed. A sunny side up runny egg is also a big thing here, which honestly I still donÂ´t get lol. I did eventually have the opportunity to have homemade paella and it was amazing. A lot of the food here grew on me though and I enjoy it now ...thankfully.

### 2. Weather

I do not like the cold. In fact, I am one they would call "friolera" here.( Sommeone who always feels cold) Of course, coming from the caribbean people always ask me why I came to Europe. What was I thinking? I sometimes reflect on it, especially in the winter. But the truth is the winters here are not THAT bad and we are not bombarded by
snow. It is usually moderate. The most troublesome thing is not having a wadrobe big enough to have winter and summer clothes sections and having to retire your summer clothes in a suitcase in order to revive your winter jackets, scarfs and boots...Not that fun.I remember always having to check the weather app before I left the house too.Feeling cold in your home and not having sufficient heating to sleep. Also not fun lol. The summers here are hot and sticky. But I still prefer it over winter.I can wear almost anything I want.Dont really need to depend on the weather app too much and I am apparently so much lighter.But yes suncreen, suncreen suncreen. Very important! Because
that sun will burn you alive here and there are barely any clouds during the hot summer months!

### 3. Culture

Everyone is always out even on weekdays.It is always a social scene, I would have to say even more than my own country and we do love a party there.It is super commom to see a lot of people having drinks after work ANY DAY of the week and yes that means even on Monday.I suppose older people with kids not so much but you may even see a small child
at 10pm on a Wednesday in a restaurant type bar with their parents while they have a drink and meal.

### 4. Racism and feeling outsider syndrome

So this is a topic I have heard about in certain countries in Europe and Spain is no exception.However, I would have to say I am lucky to be living in a big city with many cultural influences and ethnicities and I have not seen many cases of racism.I would share however, times when I felt a little isolated and discriminated against, racism even; for example a lady not sitting next to me on the underground ... but that may be a topic for another blog or vlog.

### 5. Language Barriers

It feels nice to feel like you fit in somewhere and belong.However,being a foreigner in a country with a completely distinct mother tongue to your own is difficult. And feeling like you fit in, especially when you stand out so much; that feeling can actually come and go! The language barrier does not help.There are times difficult words and expressions can make conversation pretty tough.Sometimes depending on events you go to, for example plays, museums, excusions, it can be a challenge.
