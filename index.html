                Just some of my main hobbies and interests.There are quite a few <br>

                continuously grow and learn as much as I can while I am alive.I want to make the most of <br>this
             time I have while young- *cough cough*-well relatively young, study new languages, explore <br>the world.
            For this reason, when I was 24 I left my job as a quality analyst with a telecommunications <br>company in my country<br >
            and decided to move to Spain to start a new chapter in life.Curious and want to read about my <br>experience
            then stay tuned to my posts and advice!<br>The story continues...</p>
