## Amsterdam Awakening - Posted on the 11th of July 2020

You may have heard before that travelling awakens you in such a way that you would have never realized before doing so. The perspectives that you gain and the things that you see can certainly leave a life long impression and definitely affect the way you think about your own life... your own decisions.

Well, it is true.

And that awakening happened to me on my solo trip to Amsterdam. So this had probably been my third solo trip and I thought - well I have been down this road before. I was so used to using google maps, finding my way around and asking people for directions. In the northern european countries, they also seemed to dominate the english language pretty well, so I was pretty confident. (Not like the first time travelling solo when I had an anxiety attack)

Hence, I was off to Amsterdam alone. Initially, I didn't want to go by myself and was trying to persuade my boyfriend of the time to come with me but he was busy working with his usual busy life. Regardless, I heard that the city was really beautiful and ended up going. And I had to totally agree when I got into the city. I went in November (that was when I could get the cheapest tickets), so the weather was pretty cold and rainy, but the city really impressed me. The dark red and brown hues on the building surfaces, the canals and the hundreds of cyclists that flew past me. How green and clean it was, it just seemed like such a well designed, lovely place.

I would only be spending a couple days at that time-a weekend- so I had to make the best of it.
I made my way to the **I Amsterdam sign** which is a common place to take photos close to the airport. Then I started exploring by going through vondel park to check out the lakes and things like that and was suprised to find people exercising in the rain. The park is very large and has many picnic areas and trails. I made my way through the park into the city center and on my journey tried to reach my boyfriend to tell him that I had arrived in Amsterdam safely. I tried sending a whatsApp as I couldn't get a call through but he didn't respond.

I ended up walking around visiting the prettty little bakeries and the national monuments, the main palace, the San NicolÃ¡s cathedral and then I made my way to Prinsengracht neighbourhood to pass by the Anne Frank house. I had thoughts of visiting inside but when I saw the ridiculously long line, those thoughts vanquished.ðŸ˜… I only had about two days and couldn't wait in a line forever.

I decided to go near the red light zone to check out this infamous street and honestly the only thing that ran through my mind was how beautiful the canals and streets of Amsterdam were, how they intertwined harmoniously, how the steps and bridges were nestled around them. That was until I realized that most of the day had gone by and I still didn't receive a message back from my boyfriend. It annoyed me of course but I tried not to let it ruin my day. I went to rest at my hostel to get up early and enjoy my last day.

The next day was even rainier and let's just say the cyclists were not happy if you got in their way. I had to jump out of the way from oncoming bikers many times and run to cross the street to evade the bike path. But then looking up at the skies and trying my best to somehow ignore the weather, I realized that my boyfriend still had not reached out to me. I was very dissapointed and this had not been the first time. For the last three to five months I had been struggling to hold my relationship together. I was always the one suggesting things that we could do or places we could visit, lunch or dinner dates we could enjoy while my partner was swamped in work and never could make the time.

We lived far from eachother, me in the capital and him close to an area called Galapagar so it was hard to visit each other. And honestly, I got that he had a busy schedule as a teacher and side hustling with private classes. But classes on a Sunday? Not even making time to visit or worse yet call or send a message? It was getting pretty disrespectful. He would go days without even replying to me or messaging. And I meant DAYS.
I was pretty frustrated.

So the series of events that came next would be the straw that broke the camel's back...

I decided to go to the center later that day and spend my last evening in Amsterdam checking out the area close to the train station. I was a part of a network online called CouchSurfers, a website which allowed travellers to exchange their places of accomodation when visiting eachother's cities and I remembered talking to a guy that I met on there who offered to meet me up for a drink. I reached out to him and he told me he would meet me near the station. In 15 minutes he was there and we walked around and talked. He seemed very friendly and it felt nice to have some company.

Then he goes... "It is very cold, you can come to my place for some tea before you go" I was so cold for real, that I accepted. I didn't see any danger. So he paid for my ticket and we took the tram 10 minutes to his place. It was small and cosy, and it felt so good to be out of the rain and to be in the warmth. He goes to the kitchen and makes the tea while I sit on the couch. Five minutes later while drinking tea and talking about Amsterdam and his life there he starts to get very close. I move away slightly. Then he awkwardly tries to lean in to kiss me! I jump up immediately and shout " What are you doing?!" I literally did not think this was where he wanted to go. I was not attracted to him in the least but regardless I was not that kind of person.

He starts to explain that I am very lovely- blah blah -and he wants to spend time with me. I try to keep calm. What I did was **SO** stupid to trust this complete stranger. He seemed so nice and was verified on CouchSurfers. It was too late to realize that that did not matter...
I tried to stay calm because he did not seem aggressive. I told him I was with someone and I was a faithful person, I could not. He started to touch my arm and beg in this super desperate way that I kiss him. I backed away and said I needed to go now!

He saw that I was upset and said "at least let me walk you to the tram"
I said alright just to get him to go into the bedroom to get his coat. When he was out of sight, I grabbed my bag and coat and ran out the apartment at once! I ran and ran and did not stop running until I had gotten 8 blocks away from his place.
I felt so disgusted and scared. I just needed to get to the bus that would take me back to the airport.

I pulled out Google maps and began again my solitary walk of shame.
It was so crazy to think I could have been raped. I felt like such an idiot. And I realized that I could never trust anyone like that again. There were too many predators and I was still a naive traveller. I pulled out my phone to see that my boyfriend still had not messaged me.
Furious and sad I decided to call him when I was on the bus.

I told him that I could have almost been raped and asked him why he couldn't make time to just see if I was okay. I had felt that he was not even concerned about my well-being. His reply was what sold it for me...

_" I am sorry this thing happen to you but that is not my fault"_

Like REALLY. I had never said it was his fault! I just wanted to feel like I mattered and that he could make time for me, to check on me. Then the sweet awakening happened. I realized that this guy would never be there for me nor for us. I would never matter to him. He was only about himself. I told him there and then...I was done.

And it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Travelling and that unfortunate situation really opened my eyes and I had to accept that as a part of me growing. Even if the danger did not occur, this trip was proof that everything can become so clear to you when you take that first courageous step alone.
