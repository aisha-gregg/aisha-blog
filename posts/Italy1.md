## Bourgiono Italy (Milan and Lago di Como) - Posted on the 25th of April, 2020

Gorgeous Italy. The country I have most frequented within the walls of Europe. Its breathtaking cities stretch from the southern capital of Rome, to Florence, Pisa and up north to Milan. And this is exactly where we travelled to in May of 2019. - A very unexpected trip actually.

Some friends and I decided to take a surprise trip with a company called FlyKube. FlyKube is a company that organizes surprise trips for different budgets. I will put their link here if anyone wants to check them out: https://www.flykube.com/

We paid 400 euros for a trip - hotel and flight included - for a chance to visit one country in Europe and also a shot at visiting Morocco. We waited for about a month and saw that our surprise location was Milan.

I was estatic! I had visited Italy once before but only the popular cities of Venice and Rome and had lost some of the photos that I had captured. Having the opportunity to create new moments in Italy again was all too welcoming. We flew into Milan three days after we found out about our trip and took a coach to the city ready to head to our hotel. The hotel was a bit old but the breakfast selection was abundant. We set out that evening to enjoy the city visiting important monuments such as:

1. **Galleria Vittorio.**
   This gallery is not exactly a gallery as you would imagine with artwork per se. It is actually a huge domed-covered walkthrough mall which holds many little boutiques, shops and restuarants. It is believed to be the oldest mall in Italy. You can also find high end products such as Louis Vuitton and Prada. Near the center of the gallery there is a mosiac of a bull on the floor. The legend is (there is always one, right?üòÜ) that you must stand on the bull and spin three times on one heel.This is known to bring good fortune and a life of luck. Hey, doesn't hurt to try, right? üòâ

2. **Sforza Castle.**
   This castle which was built in the 15th century is a beautiful time piece from the days of old. Now it is the home of many museusm and art collections and remains a lovely place to talk photos. Sitting right next to Park Sempione, it is easily acessible.

3. **Sempione Park.**
   This is a lovely spacious park in the center of Milan which is home to many local performers. If the weather is nice you can take a stroll, have a picnic, take a bike ride or head to the bar near the lake. There are a few restuarants and even a library and theatre!

4. **San Bernardino alle Ossa.**
   This peculiar place was in older times an ossuary which was used to store human bones.It was destroyed in 1712 and a new church was built in its place to be dedicated to Saint Bernard. The interior is decorated in rococo style using decorative bones and skulls for its inner walls. It is surely an interesting place to take a few photos.

5. **The last supper painting in Santa Maria delle grazie.**
   My friends and I were unable to see this painting due to tickets being sold out but if you are a lover of art it is probably a good idea to snag those tickets quickly! After all, it is one of the most famous paintings in the world! And tickets go for around 40 euros because of this!

6) **And last but not least the Milan Cathedral.**
   This cathedral is breathtaking. It is the largest cathedral in Italy and the second biggest in the entire European continent! It stretches across the square proudly casting its shadows on everything around it. You can't help but marvel at its beautiful marble facade and its architectural touches. Understandable, as it took six centuries to finish! You can gain access to the inside or simply opt for heading to the roof to see the city views. There's an elevator option or you can walk for a cheaper price. We walked. It took maybe 7 minutes to get to the top. The views were worth the exercise!

The next day we were planning a trip to visit Lago di Como. It is located about 1hr and 20 minutes north of Milan. If you are in the region I recommend the visit. It is a beautiful lake town called Como that circles around an enormous lake. You can take a bike tour, which is what we did. It also has a beautiful park and is lined with many italian restuarants. I would say the best things to see there include:

1. **The Como Cathedral.**

2. **Basilica di Sant'Abbondio.**

3. **Taking the Funicular to neighbouring Brunate.**

4. **You can also take a boat ride on the lake if your pocket is healthy enough.**

Lago di Como is an exceptional getaway from the busy city of Milan. It is what I would call the perfect day trip. I had not been expecting much...but I honestly would love to return to the lake repeatedly as it just may be the perfect summer getaway location.

Heck, even George Clooney knows it. They say he has a house up there!

The next day we would head to my second favourite Italian city:

... Venice ‚ù§Ô∏è
