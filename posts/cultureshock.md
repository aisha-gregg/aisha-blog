## Living abroad and cultural differences - Posted on the 25th of July, 2020

Culture shock is something that can instantaneously _blow your mind_. It is something so moving, mind-buggling or totally contradictory to your own ways, that stands out from your own culture that is typically experienced when moving from one country to another, whether long-term or short-term. Like many, cutlural shock are experienced in many ways that can leave a long lasting impression or change the way you see the world. The experiences below are specific to the country of Spain.

When I first came to Madrid, Spain, it was strikingly different from my home. I had never seen such open streets, such numerous apartments and such large crowds.

One main difference for me is how open gay people are, the rights they have and how comfortable they live here. My first experience seeing two men kissing had been visiting the famous park of Retiro, near Atocha neighbourhood. I felt as if I was seeing something totally forbidden and just stood in shock...not really being able to turn away nor avert my eyes. I would never forget that day. In my country, I would never see anything like that in the open. _In fact,_ it is very much frowned upon, discouraged and I do not know anyone who is openly gay from my island.

Another big shock, was always being the minority race in gatherings, spanish classes, in restaurants etc, when I was so used to being within a large group of black individuals for the entirety of my life. For the first time,**I was not the 'majority'.** I felt sometimes, strange, as if I didn't belong. I sometimes hated standing out because I wanted and still do want to fit in pretty badly. Sometimes people would take pictures and I had to remind them to put flash,üòÇ where as flash in Trinidad (at night) is always a must. üò∂But for the most part I felt welcomed by the people here, they were and continue to be very friendly.

Additionally, the lifestyle of the Spanish here is to go and have a drink outside and enjoy each other's company, many times even if children are around. In my culture, there is a lot of emphasis on 'drinking to get wasted' while here it is more for sensual enjoyment. I must say also that people are generally accepting and do not really care what you wear and how you look, which is a big difference for me.I felt like growing up and going out in my country, it was always a competition to look good, there was always pressure to buy the cutest and hottest outfits. Here, I have the freedom of going out in a shorts and (_that same ole_)tank top without the snobby looks. I feel free to just enjoy life without being fancy or living up to false expectations.

Last one, and maybe it is me. But everyone here has tattoesüòÜ Even in banks, hotels, stores. I remember my mom and I talking about that fact. We grew up in a culture where if you had too many **visible** tattoes that would impede your employment opportunities (they didn't look professional) and I feel like many people in Trinidad have tattoes that can be easily covered while in Madrird I have seen some outrageous tattoes; on necks, foreheads, hands- you name it , it is done.üòè

My name is Mayowa and I am French (born and brought up in France) and Nigerian. I spent one year and a half living in the magical and beautiful city of Madrid. Since France and Spain are close geographically, I would say that there aren‚Äôt many cultural differences. In both countries, people are epicurean and like to gather for good endless meals and both have chauvinist tendencies - people are proud of their region (referred to as ‚ÄúMi Tierra‚Äù in Spanish or ‚ÄúC‚Äôest le sud‚Äù proudly said after any compliment made to southern French about their region. Yet, I can talk about cultural ‚Äúshock‚Äù:
**Politeness, friendliness, kindness:** that‚Äôs something I had the pleasure to experience as a foreigner. Spanish are very friendly and kind. I‚Äôve noticed politeness especially in the Spanish Administration.
**People are more outgoing, extraverted and less judgmental:** depending on the region, I feel that in France people will not approach you that easily. In Spain, people don‚Äôt systemically criticise others nor mock them.
**Drinks and food can be incredibly cheap:** That applies especially to the drinks. Overall, going out in Spain is always a great deal.
**The noise:** Yes, the Spanish are louder than the French.üòÜ
**Private schools vs. public schools:** In Spain, private schools are known to provide premium education compared to public schools whereas in France public schools usually provide quality education. Actually, if you go to a private school as a teen, it may even imply such a bad school report that public schools didn‚Äôt want to allow your enrollment in their facility. Moreover in France, we don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcolegios concertados‚Äù which are schools financed by the private sector but that are also subventioned by the government.
**The way they take things easily:** they are quite relaxed compared to the French. The positive aspect is how people in Spain tend to easily and randomly decide to go for a drink afterwork and go out late at night despite the fact of working early morning. On the other hand, sometimes I felt like things were not always well structured legally in terms of contracts.
Globally, I loved living in Spain and would definitely recommend it. I literally had a crush on Madrid.

When I arrived in √Åguilas, people would often stare or make comments at their tables or to their friends when passing me. Some would hold their purses, and others would approach me to ask me where I was from, which I believe was because I wore my natural hair in an afro and have tattoos on my arm. I was even solicited for prostitution a few times by men of various ages.

If they were able to actually find the courage to speak to me and found out that I was American, they became a bit less apprehensive and more open. I called this passport privilege. Even when I went to my schools to turn in paperwork, I was often mistaken for being the French Language Assistant. Also, when I told them I was American, I was asked about my African lineage. One of the teachers I worked with, even openly admitted to me she did not like Moroccan children as they were the worst.

I had not heard much about the racism here because it does not get documented as thoroughly as the United States and other countries. Actually, Spain has some of the most relaxed laws on Hate Crimes in the world, along with the fact that most of the Black community here are undocumented and often want to fly under the radar.

By the end of my first year, I knew I could handle the racism and just enjoy the quality of life I was experiencing. I had health insurance for the first time in years and was able to go to get medical checkups for FREE. I also only have to work 15 hours a week, so I can focus on my self-improvement and create a business I had always dreamed of.

It‚Äôs not about finding the perfect place to live; it‚Äôs about being the best place within yourself.
