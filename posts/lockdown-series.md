Time continues to creep forward. Two months ago I was trying to [survive quarantine](/posts/quarantine) in Spain. At that time, I would become easily bored, unmotivated and tired. I created a quarantine schedule in order to keep myself productive, exercise and make the extra effort to read more. It has worked fairly well. Regarding the city of Madrid, well it seemed almost ghost-like, occupied only by its looming shadows. The sound of a car passing along the road every now and then and the light footsteps to ‚Äòthe essential places' reminded me that the future was there waiting.

Fast forward to _The Now._

Frustration has led to protest in the streets, as some of Spain‚Äôs citizens felt like the government was not doing enough. Some of them, overwhelmed parents struggling with balancing their children‚Äôs school routine and their work life. I did feel a bit anxious or sad about it but I stayed in, protected by my four walls. Learning to pass the time by continuously learning.

But yes... things are now slowly improving. Just this week Madrid entered phase 1 of the de-escalation plan that the government has laid out for us. With this comes visiting friends and family ( in groups no bigger than 10) and eating out on the restaurant terraces. Eating in is still not allowed.

For me, It is strange yet amazing to see how things are continuously transforming and to see the social side of people again. To be able to go outside and just appreciate everything. Everyone has been out lately, taking in as much sunlight as they could. Neighbours greeting each other, children playing, people celebrating as it would seem. Cases seem to be dropping, protests dwindling.

And although, many have lost something during this time, I hope to encourage everyone to look forward to a better tomorrow.

**LOCKED IN, NOW WHAT?** üìç Bournemouth,üá¨üáß

Forced to stay indoors, working from home, if you must go out it‚Äôs at two meters away from everyone else and to get food from the supermarkets means joining theme park styled queues, which takes an age to get inside; thanks COVID-19 for throwing in a new ingredient to the cocktail of life in the UK.

At first, I was elated for all the free time!
Started with planning what I‚Äôd be doing and pinpointing when they‚Äôd be completed, then suddenly I started to feel the pressure of possibly having too much time on my hands, which then turned into days of doing absolutely nothing but consuming all the negativity in the news.

Miss Rona had my mental health out of whack and I needed a mindset reset but how was I meant to do that when the simple pleasures of going about my business freely and meeting up with friends had been ripped away?
Something had to change and it needed to be me, so I found ways to get and sustain motivation in my home turned gym, work and after work chill out spot. Granted it's a weird world at the moment for everyone, unlearning old habits and adopting new ones to survive, hard but necessary to keep spirits up.

Recently, we‚Äôve entered some sort of phase where it's permitted to travel 50 miles to wherever we want whenever we want for exercise or no exercise; can meet friends in open spaces and even the luxury of catering places being reopened for delivery or drive through only.

The total lockdown I must admit has taught me to be kinder to myself by reuniting me with my favourite hobbies, keeping up with the healthy eating and exercise challenges, staying connected with friends, not leaving my yaad, showing my support for the NHS with a round of applause every Thursday evening (which has now ended) and finally seeing an opportunity in every setback.
That last one, the whole world is going to have to take that approach when this is all over, but we can do it in our own lives now.

**AUSTRALIA DURING CORONA** üìç Sydney, üá¶üá∫

We are very lucky in Australia to have not been hit too hard with the virus over the last few months. Although we have still been in quite a strict lockdown since the end of March. Everything changed really quickly for us in the start - one minute we were all living our lives, and the next we were only allowed out of the house to exercise or shop for necessities.

For most of April and May we were only allowed to meet one other person outside, and it had to be for exercise, and no one from outside the household was allowed into the house. Most people are still working from home and all restaurants and cafes have been closed except for takeaway. There have been border restrictions so we are unable to leave Australia, and unable to leave our own state.
At the moment they have started easing restrictions, with 10 people allowed to sit in restaurants at a time, 5 people to visit a household, and we are allowed to meet 10 people for a picnic. From June 1 these are being loosened again so 50 people can go out to eat at a time and we are allowed to travel within our state.

It has been a really strange time here. Around my area of Sydney, everyone has been super careful ever since the pandemic started. People are all social distancing at the shops and using the hand sanitizer provided. It‚Äôs really good to see how everyone has come together at this time!

For me it has been really hard! My boyfriend lives in Sweden and was meant to be visiting Australia in April to meet my friends and family. Travel restrictions mean we are unable to be together for who knows how long, and it has been really tough on both of us.

**MAKING THE BEST OF IT.** üìç Texas, üá∫üá∏

As the corona virus makes it way around Texas once again, many are learning what it means and how to adjust to this new normal. For me personally, things seem relatively the same.

Aside from wearing a face mask and having to keep my distance from others my day to day life hasn‚Äôt seen much of a shift. I‚Äôve been able to continue going to work and most parks, restaurants, gyms, and trails have begun to reopen... for better or for worse.

I‚Äôd like to say everyone here is taking the situation seriously but due to the high amounts of massless people, group gatherings, and jokes being made... I can‚Äôt say everyone‚Äôs on the same page. Despite this, I do think there‚Äôs a bigger sense of community in Texas. Everyone‚Äôs helping everyone. I‚Äôve seen full neighborhoods coming together to support others, as well as small acts of kindness constantly.

The times aren‚Äôt ideal but people are making the best out of what they have!

**THE NEW NORMAL** üìç üáπüáπ

I love being home ‚Äì but this is different. I took for granted the simple things: the commute to work, the almost daily 3 p.m. phone calls to bring a bread home, the Sunday evening strolls with my sister to get ice cream by the corner. Honestly, I was dreaming of how amazing 2020 was going to be.

But COVID-19 shattered not only my mundane routine and aspirations, but it rained havoc on every other aspect of my life. I watched as the world still but time still moved on.

I cycled through a myriad of emotions for the past two months. I was lucky enough to be working at home but with my mother no longer being able to work - I began to feel the weight of the pandemic.

It did not stop there. See‚Ä¶my family lives with a never ending ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô. Each time my aunt leaves to go to work in the hospital the question pops up like a jack in a box.

What if an asymptomatic patient who came in today?

What if the numbers rise and my aunt is mandated to deal with COVID-19 patients?

What if she gets infected?

What if one of us gets infected?

We silence our fears and live with a new routine ‚Äì
Sanitize everything.
Stay indoors.
Wear a mask if going outdoors.
Wash your hands.
Sanitize your hands.
Keep six feet away from everyone else.
Do not get infected.

Welcome
to our new
normal.
