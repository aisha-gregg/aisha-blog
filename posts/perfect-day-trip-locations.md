## Perfect Spanish day trips

So you have just come to Spain and you are wondering about the cities that you can explore. If you have just recently moved particularly to Madrid this blog post is perfect for the newcommer who is looking for a few day trips that can be done from the beautiful sunny capital. Spain provides that perfect mix of beautiful mountainous terrain, plains, shores, lakes and lovely quaint villages and towns which are referred to by the Spanish as 'pueblos'. Even better is that you can find all these magistic like features within just a couple hours from the city.

So let's dive into these top 6 perfect places to visit in a day from Madrid.

1. San Lorenzo de El Escorial

El Escorial is a lovely mountainous town located to the north west, one hour outside of Madrid. The main features of the town are the San Lorenzo monastery, palace and museum which you can visit, including the gardens. It was ordained by King Felipe the II and consists of lovely gardens which wind around the palace. Of course, also coming with that complementary peacock or two that seems to be the norm here in Spain. Twenty minutes away and accesible by car is the royal seat of King Felipe the II, which ia a world heritage site. It is a beautiful look out point where you can get amazing views of the palace and the surrounding forests. It is also great exercise getting up to the hill. When you sit on the seat- and hopefully you do - you can certainly feel a sense of power and history sweeping you away.

After coming down from the mountains, check out the town of El Escorial where you can have generous hearty meals of steak, patatas bravas, croquetas and other delicious spanish food from the region.

How do you get to and from El Escorial? The town has an accesiblity rating of **10!** And you can easily get there by train, bus or car.

2. Cuenca

Cuenca is a tiny pueblo that is nourished by its beautiful lake and infamous for its 'hanging houses' which somehow seem to float on the mountains there. It is a little further out of the city, actually belonging to the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha which is south of Madrid. It takes around an hour and 40 minutes to arrive there but it is surely worth it for its picturesque views and the curous cave like settings. Cuenca has a very interesting history, initially being inhabited by the moors it tries to retain some of this influence. Things to see in Cuenca include the hanging houses, the cathedral and the San Pablo bridge.

Getting to Cuenca is a bit tougher and would probably get an accesibility rating of 7. You can get there by bus, car or train. But the train is slow and takes around 2 hours.

3. Aranjuez

Aranjuez is a town sitting right next to Toledo (another must see location) and boasts of its palace and river Tajo- Tagus in English. The palace is the perfect picture of essence with its royal gardens and meadows. So much so that the kings of Spain visited here on various locations. In 2001 it was listed as a world heritage site and continues to be a must see for every visitor. Besides the palace, gardens and museum, there is not a whole lot to see, but the streets and houses and quite lovely and you can also partake in kayaking in the river for some fun! Getting to Aranjuez is fairly easy as there is a local train every 30 minutes. There is also bus access and of course you can get there by car. The city would get an accesibilty factor of 9.

4. Alcalá de Henares

Alcalá de Henares boasts of a big history with a gorgeous historical town. It takes around 40 minutes to 1 hour to get there by train. You can visit many sites such as the college of San Ildefonso which is one of the most pretigious colleges in Madrid , the cervantes square which is a medieval square where a lot of activites take place, the cervantes birthplace, the santos niños and the Madrid gate.
