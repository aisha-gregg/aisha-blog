## Perfect Spanish day trips

So you have just come to Spain and you are wondering about the cities that you can explore. If you have just recently moved in particular to Madrid this blog post is perfect for the newcomer who is looking for a few day trips that can be done from the beautiful sunny capital. Spain provides that perfect mix of beautiful mountainous terrain, plains, shores, lakes and lovely quaint villages and towns which are referred to by the Spanish as 'pueblos'. And yes many may have heard of larger towns and cities such as Segovia, Toledo and Salamanca but in this post we will look to the even smaller ones! Even better is that you can find all of these magistic like places within just a couple hours from the city, right under your nose!

So let's dive into these top 6 perfect places to visit in a day from Madrid.

1. San Lorenzo de El Escorial

El Escorial is a lovely mountainous town located to the north west, one hour outside of Madrid. The main features of the town are the San Lorenzo monastery, palace and museum which you can visit for free. It was ordained by King Felipe the II and consists of lovely gardens which wind around the palace. Of course also coming with that complementary peacock or two that seems to be the norm here in Spain. Twenty minutes away and accesible by car is [the royal seat of King Felipe the II,](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/silla-de-felipe-ii-phillip-ii-chair) which is a world heritage site. It is a beautiful look out point where you can get amazing views of the palace and the surrounding forests. It is also great exercise getting up to the hill as you can hike up. When you sit on the seat- and hopefully you do - you can certainly feel a sense of power and history sweeping you away.

After coming down from the mountains, check out the town of El Escorial which is beautiful. Here you can have generous hearty meals of steak, patatas bravas, croquetas and other delicious spanish food from the region.

How do you get to and from El Escorial? The town has an accesiblity rating of **10!** And you can easily get there by train (C3 from Atocha station), bus or car.

2. Cuenca

Cuenca is a tiny pueblo that is nourished by its beautiful lake and infamous for its 'hanging houses' which somehow seem to float on the mountains there. It is a little further out of the city, actually belonging to the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha which is south of Madrid. It takes around an hour and 40 minutes to arrive there but it is surely worth it for its picturesque views and the curious cave like settings. Cuenca has a very interesting history, initially being inhabited by the moors it tries to retain some of this influence. Things to see in Cuenca include the hanging houses, the cathedral and the San Pablo bridge.

Getting to Cuenca is a bit tougher and would probably get an accesibility rating of **6.** You can get there by bus, car or train. But the train is slow and takes around 2 hours.

3. Aranjuez

Aranjuez is a town sitting right next to [Toledo](https://www.spainthenandnow.com/spanish-history/toledo-historical-overview)(another must see location) and boasts of its palace and river Tajo- Tagus in English. The palace is the perfect picture of essence with its royal gardens and meadows. So much so that the kings of Spain visited there on various occasions. In 2001, it was listed as a world heritage site and continues to be a must see for every visitor. Besides the palace, gardens and museum, there is not a whole lot to see, but the streets and houses are quite lovely and you can also partake in kayaking in the river for some fun! Getting to Aranjuez is fairly easy as there is a local train every 30 minutes. If this is too much of a wait, there is also bus access and of course you can get there by car. The city would get an accesibilty factor of **8.**

4. Alcalá de Henares

Alcalá de Henares boasts of a big history within a gorgeous historical town. And it has ever right to do so, being the birth place of the renowed writer [Cervantes.](https://www.biography.com/writer/miguel-de-cervantes) It takes around 40 minutes to 1 hour to get there by train. (You can take the train C2 from Atocha station.) You can visit many sites such as the college of San Ildefonso which is one of the most pretigious colleges in Madrid and the cervantes square which was a medieval square back in the day! Now, it is a main square where a lot of activites, markets and festivals take place. You can even visit Cervantes' birthplace, where it is free to enter the home turned museum. You can see where and how this amazing writer lived his life. Other popular sites within Alcalá include the Santos niños and the Madrid gate. Alcalá is very accesible, as you can get there by bus, train and car. We would give it an accesibility factor of **10.**

4. Buitrago del Lozoya

Located to the north of Madrid lies the town of Buitrago del Loyoza. This town is very quaint and small featuring a large river from which the town gets its name. It also houses a museum dedicated to the work of Picasso, a castle which was forged by the moors and was built as a means of protection from invaders. The castle became a possession of the catholics by 1085. Many of the original catapults built of roman architecture remains there and you can even go on a guided tour of the castle to see how the catapults work and to see the armor knights wore back then. It is an interesting tour for sure!

Additionally, Buitrago makes the **perfect** day trip on those hot scorching summer days because of its natural pools ([piscinas naturales](https://www.zonaviajero.com/piscinas-naturales-buitrago-lozoya/)) which are opened to the public for a small fee of 4 to 5 euros. The pools and in general the surroundings are breathtaking as you get views of the mountains and nearby lake. I would highly recommend this town. However, getting there is not that easy. By car it takes about 1 hour. There is also a bus, Alsa 191, which takes you from the station _Plaza Castilla_ to the town in approximately 2 hours. Therefore the accesibility factor is a little lower, Buitrago will get a point 5.

5. Brihuega

Recently, I had the option of visiting this beautiful town by car which is popular for its lavander fields. It is a breathtaking lovely place with beautiful cottage like houses and fields of purple hues which stretch on for miles. You can easily pass one day exploring the main square, the María Cristina park, a secret arab cave, the two beautiful stone castles (Piedra Bermeja and Peña Bermeja) and skipping through the lavander fields...getting gorgeous photos for those life-long memories with family and friends. Visit the local restaurants such as [El Asador El Tomo](http://asadoreltolmo.com/) and [La Peña Bermeja](https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g1435650-d2204901-Reviews-La_Pena_Bermeja-Brihuega_Province_of_Guadalajara_Castile_La_Mancha.html)for delicious fresh vegetables and mouth-watering steaks.

So how do you get there, you may ask?

Well it is not a walk in the park. You would need a car as there are no other other real forms of transport there. Well, unless you take the local train (C2) from Atocha train station and somehow catch a taxi or shared car service. This unfortunately causes Brihuega to get an accesibility rating of 3. But hey, sometimes the most difficult places to get to are the most beautiful.

And that's that!

Hope this list of places encourages you. And hope you can find that travelling close to home can show you wonders that have always been...right under your nose :)
