## Oh my, Marseille! - Posted on the 28th of March, 2020

On August 3rd of last summer, I saw the blue seas of the southern french coast for the first time in my life. In French, it is famously known as cote d'azur (the french riviera). They were a radiant blue that went on for miles even caressing popular cities such as Cannes (which we visited for a day), Saint-Tropez, Nice and Montpellier.

We chose to embark on an adventure in the southern city of Marseille, which is one of the lesser expensive cities you can find on the blue coast. It has a beautiful artistic mix of sea, city and mountains.

The first day we arrived we were able to catch a coach from the airport to the city for a fair price of 9 euro per person. All coaches charged around this fee. It then took us about 50 minutes to get to the city bus terminal and train station.

The bus terminal sits on a hilly platform so that when you exit the main station you see some pretty decent views of the city around you. You need to climb down numerous stairs (It's actually not as bad as it sounds) and from there you can catch a taxi or walk depending on the location of your hotel, hostel or Airbnb.

We walked for about 15 to 20 minutes to get to our Airbnb. It was in a central location close to Castelane and honestly very lovely.It was a duplex with beautiful french windows which allowed for daily sunlight to flood the house. We also had a view of a small garden. It was probably the best Airbnb experience I've ever had.

So why France?

Well, for one, I had always heard of the french riviera being an absolute dream! And secondly, I decided I would take French classes while I was there in Marseille for one week in order to gain appreciation for another language. I registered with a school called "l'Ecole Internationale de Marseille" (International school of Marseille) and while it was small the staff and teachers there were incredibly helpful and encouraging. I would 100% recommend them!

I did a lower A2 course which gave me so much insight although I was completely lost half of the time!
I was able to walk from my apartment to the school every morning at 9am. It took me on average 15 minutes. Sometimes, I experienced a deja vu effect or so much nostalgia those mornings. This is because my first month in Spain also consisted of me going to classes at 9am to learn Spanish. It felt like I was starting anew in another city, another lifestyle, another culture. I felt like France was now my new home...It was not. But the feeling was nice. The change, even if for a moment... was nice.

The differences between Spain and France immediately stood out. Places such as shops and supermarkets seemed to open a lot later than the typical spanish store. However, it was summer and during this time store schedules are usually reduced in both countries. Wine was expensive! In Spain you can have a glass of wine for 2 euro 50. In France, the cheapest wine was around 5 euro. I must admit though, the wine that I had there- insanely good. In Marseille, the evenings are ridiculously quiet however I suppose it is normal for a smaller city of 860,000 people compared to bigger capitals. The French have dinner around 8pm (or earlier) and restuarants close early so be prepared.

Marseille sits on a hilly coast line surrounded by mountain and blue seas. It is fairly small and you can get to the beaches and the centre with buses or by walking. The most popular beach in the city is Catalan beach which is surprisingly very clean for being so close to the city.

Places to visit:

**The Old Port.** Here you can get souvenirs and catch a ferry to visit the calanques.

**The Notre Dame de la Garde.** This is the church that sits on the largest hill overlooking the city.You get breathtaking views of the city and the sea below you. Also, take a moment to enjoy the sunset. You will have such a relaxing time and there isn't too much of a crowd either!

**Palais Lonchamp.** This was a stunning gem that we got to see our last day in Marseille.It is a monument with a park and an art and history museum.The main feature is the large bull sculpture and fountain.

**Marseille Santa Maria Cathedral.** If you are into cathedrals and arquitecture this monument sits close to the dock in the city and stands out for its romanesque style-it is white with dark brown stripes running over its surface.

**The Calanque National Park**. This was my favourite! It is a tiring journey and you can get to the calanques two ways:

1. Taking a ferry from the old port.

2. Taking a bus ride for about 40 minutes from Castelane to Luminy university city. From here you can hike for about 1-2 hours to Morgiou calanque. There is a small restuarant there but you need to walk with cash. If you'd like you can also hike to Sugiton Calanque from Morigou for another painstaking 2 hours! üòÜ But it is absolutely beautiful and sooo worth the trip!üòç

Just some advice: Walk with some water shoes because the stones where you bathe can hurt your feet. And the water is super-and I mean, SUPER cold!

**Visit Cassis.** Cassis is a beautiful port city located 35 minutes outside of Marseille. You can catch a bus in Castelane. The beaches and the food there are incredible. The fish soup speciality there is called "Bouillabaisse".

The people in Marseille where very nice and at the end of the week I found myself understanding the clerks in the stores and some people in the street.I am super content with my French immersion and would recommend it to anyone looking to improve or start a new language. Today I am still learning French and hope to have another summer immersion soon.

Hmm, which French city should I visit next?

Thanks for reading! xo
