## London Adventures - Posted on the 3rd of May, 2020

_One thing about London is that when you step out into the night, it swallows you._

-SEBASTIAN FAULKS, Engleby.

**London**; the city of the river Thames, of fish and chips, of dark gothic architectural facades, of the vibrant dark nights and the towering Eye. It is a city that both captivates you and swallows you. It is huge, spreading over an area of 1,572 kilometres! Considering the 14 million people making up London and the greater London area, it reigns as the largest city in Europe. There are many things to do and see in London and you will love the diversity that you see. There is a large indian population - which indeed brought back a homey feeling for me- as well as many indian resturants and establishments. There are also many other diverse ethnicities.

> It is a city that both captivates you and swallows you.

Walking through the streets you can find many treasures:

**1. The Buckingham Palace.**

The Bukingham Palace is the residence of the british monarchy. Its white walls stretch across constitution hill and is used for various official ceremonies like state visits and tourists visits. During your visit you can see the famous _'changing of the guard'_ which happens around 11 am daily. It is a scene to behold, the uniforms, the marching and just the true essence of this tradition which surely is unlike any other city you have visited.

**2. James Park.**

Cross the street past the Victoria Memorial and stroll through the gardens in St. James Park to view how the flowers bloom. There you can find a large lake where you can take a rest or even have a picnic. Cross the park and _'The Mall'_ street and you can also visit the palace of St. James.

**3.Trafalgar Square and National Gallery.**

The square sits in front of the national gallery where you can enter for free and view some of the most famous pieces of british art over a collection of some 2,300 paintings.

**4.The Shard.**

The shard rises 95 stories high and remains the tallest building in London. Tourists can go to the observation deck and catch impressive views of the city of London below. This view of the city can be seen from the 72nd floor.

**5.Shakespeare's Globe.**

This reconstruction of the globe theatre lies in Southwark 230 metres from the original theatre which was destroyed in 1614. If you love theatre and Shakespeare it is worth visiting this gem, where theatrical productions of shakespeare classics such as Hammlet take place.

**6.Tower Bridge.**

Tower bridge is so symbolic of London. This image lies on postcards annd souvenirs a like. The bridge lies across the river Thames and was contructed between the years 1886 and 1894. It is the most famous bridge in London which connects the city to Tower Hamlets district. The supension bridge also opens to allow boat traffic to pass.

**8.Big Ben.**

The last time I visited London in 2018 the Big Ben was being renovated and is said to continue renovations until 2021. My first time in London however (in 2016), I saw the great bell tower for the first time in all its glory. The Big Ben is actually a nick name for the clock tower. It was designed by Augutus Pugin and finished in 1859 to be the most beautiful gothic-style clock tower in the world.

**9.The London Eye.**

Lastly, but certainly not least is the London Eye! It is the fourth largest observation wheel in the world! To get on the wheel there is a charge of between 37 to 40 pounds per adult aka it aint cheap.ðŸ˜… On the wheel you spend 30 minutes in the air and have a spectacular view of the city. I heard that the sunsets are amazing up there as well. One day, I hope to experience that!

There is absolutely no way I could list all the monuments, palaces and things to see in London. It is a bubbling pot filled with leisure activities for all. Whether it's shopping in Oxford or Carnaby street, taking a double-decker bus across to Picadilly Circus, exploring the food at Bourough Market, or hanging out at the trendy bars and shops in Canary wharf... The city has so much to offer!

So...What's your favorite part of London?
