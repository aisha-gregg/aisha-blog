## Bilbao - Posted on the 9th of May, 2020

This post is a flashback to a couple months ago before the end of the world... to when an unexpected trip was being taken. A trip to the basque country, the city of Bilbao.
Now, this was going to be my first time in the north of Spain ‚Äîexcept for my visit to Barcelona which is located on the north eastern mediterranean coast‚Äî so I had no idea what to expect. I heard of the north of Spain being lush with greenery, hills that encapsulated little towns and cities, shorelines that almost touched the grass and a wet moist atmosphere prone to many rainy days. I was a little bit concerned of the weather, it being January and all but I had the opportunity to go to Bilbao for a coding event that was being held there and was very much interested as it is a field of mine.

Getting to Bilbao by train took around 5 hours. On the specific route I took, you pass through small cities within the mainland like Valladolid, Burgos and Mirando de Ebro which is a small town I have never heard of before üò∂, which borders the basque country. The train then continues through Vitoria and then finally into Bilbao. The further up north you go, the lusher the mainland becomes, the more the hills roll and dip, dispersing into a remarkable contrast from that of the south of Spain.

From the time you enter the train station, which stands out as well for its facade and glasswork to when you hit the streets you are surrounded by pretty impressive architectural work; unique buildings, constructions and contemporary designs done by famous Spanish architects such as Javier P√©rez and Nicol√°s Espinosa. Because of these features Bilbao has transformed as one of the most unique cities in the world.

So let's dive right into it! What can you see and do in Bilbao you may ask?

**1. Walk alongside the canal where the Nervi√≥n river runs and admire the city.**

This river flows through the city and provides quaint lovely views. There are open spaces around where you can sit and relax. The canal is actually very wide and composes of many bridges. These bridges connect the east and west districts so that you can get to them quite easily.

**2. Visit the old town (Casco Viejo)**

This area is perfect for getting the more authetic vibe of Bilbao. Narrow colorful streets, adorned with bars and shops which you can spend an entire day exploring. (Or maybe half a day, it's not _that_ big! ) The Casco Viejo also holds the cathedral of Bilbao, an archeological museum and the main square which is very similar to the typical spanish squares you can see in every town or city. Crossing over near the canal you see luscious views near the canals which make you feel for a moment like you are in Amsterdam.

**3. Full your face with pintxos!**

The diet can surely wait in a city like Bilbao where the pintxos (pinchos) are to die for! They are tapa like food and appetizers but get its name from the fact that they are usually eaten off of a skewer. The variety, cost and taste get a solid 10 in my opinion and can only be compared to the variety and flavour you can find in the southern spanish city of Granada. There are many pintxo bars in the centre and in the square but you can also find them at the ribera market. La ribera market was constructed in 1929 and sits on the outskirts of Casco Viejo, right next to Nervi√≥n river. It houses a large assortment of pintxos and drinks and is where the main food scene of Bilbao lies. Here you can also find local products and beverages such as Chacol√≠, a white wine from the basque country.

**4. Visit the Mount Artxanda lookout**

If you would love to catch a spectacular panoramic view of the city, you can take a funicular cable car to the top of mount Artxanda. There you can walk around, take photos of this unique city and even catch some very good restaurants to have lunch or dinner.

**5. Visit the Guggenheim Museum.**

The museum was finished in 1997 and built by architect Frank Gehry. It houses a lot of modern and unique artwork which depicts futurism, surrealism and European abstraction. The artwork in my opinion was a bit strange but to each their own. They also have a lot of impressionist and post-impressionist work (Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso) which I believed I enjoyed more. Outside the building though, there is enough to marvel at. The structure itself is an enormous abstraction of titanium and limestone which archs and folds skyward. There is a statue of a spider and her babies called **'Mother'** outside the museum, which... well... is _interesting._ And there is the Bilbao puppy which stands more than 40 feet tall behind the museum entrance (or is it the front?). It is composed of around 40,000 flowers which are changed seasonally. It is like a hugh colourful chia pet! (Chia pets... yep, I'm _that_ old üòÜ)

**6. Zubizuri Bridge**

You may cross this bridge, over river Nervi√≥n and find something very perculiar. No, not only the architectural touches. This bridge is covered with a black carpet-like material and the story is actually pretty hilarious. After being built by the architect Santiago Calatrava it was much too slippery to walk on by the people in the city. The weather did not help either! Causing numerous accidents and falls, the city had to put carpet on it in order to protect its citizens. A bit of an architectural fail, no? üòÇ But then again who does not experience them!

And that's a wrap!

I am sure there is so much more to see of this beautiful unique city, but I was only there for two days. The beach is also very close by, as well as the cities of Santander and San Sebastian.

I loved Bilbao, its quaint appearance, its canal, the buildings and the pintxos.(hehe üòè)

Honestly, even the weather was suprinsingly good when I went; nothing but golden rays of sunshine illuminating it... including all of its wondrous charm.
