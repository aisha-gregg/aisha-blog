## Surviving Quarantine

It's 8pm. The 3rd of April. Year 2020.

The sound of the usual applause echoes throughout the streets of Madrid. The applause is done every evening at 8pm in order to give thanks and appreciation to those on the frontlines battling this COVID19 pandemic. It is now an emblem of support, appreciation and hope. However, truth be told, on this very evening hope seemed dwindling.

For me, at least.

And yes, looking at the statistics is the very last thing I should be doing but each time I believe that things might be getting better...there comes those numbers spewing venomous discouragement at my face.

**The questions arise:**

When will it end? Why are we inside while nothing is getting better? How many people are out there going about their daily routine and not giving a damn about us? Who is doing this to us?

Then the anger boils over...why didn't they do anything in the beginning?? But the milk has already been spilt hasn't it...?

It's unreal thinking back to three weeks ago before everything started spinning out of control.
I was super happy in a new teaching program. I had amazing kids and really lovely teachers that I shared the classroom with. My commute was relatively short-for working in Madrid- and my schedule as well. I remember being excited to get up every morning during the work week for the first time in a verrry long time.

Soon within finding out that Madrid had a couple cases, some of us started to get a bit worried but we focused on washing our hands a **million** times a day and encouraging the kids to "cough in the inside of their elbows" and wash their hands after every class. I remember one teacher even making up a song about the virus to make the kids conscious about handwashing.

On March 8th-**international women's day** -everything changed.There was a woman's march in the center of the city and millions of people went. I even thought about going for a second but I remembered that we had a few cases already and considered it risky. I thought maybe it wouldn't be a good idea. My friend also advised against it and I thought most people would have rethought it... but...at the end no one seemed to take it seriously. By Wednesday the 8th of March schools had been ordered closed due to some spikes in the cases.

One week later we were ordered into a quarantine, if you were able to work from home you had to.

By Friday the 13th all restaurants were preparing to close. I ate my last meal at Goiko Grill-a famous burger joint in the city-that very Friday.

The first week, I will not lie, was very tough in quarantine especially living and working in a small space...with other people. I continued supporting my teachers online as they told me and the other auxiliars at my school that we would still be needed. I have been doing recordings, sending links to resources and so on. To keep busy I have been taking up baking, I have been exercising and writing. I definitely encourage everyone to pick up a hobby and learn something new to pass this difficult time.

However, I sometimes think of the blessing I have been given... to be in a comfortable space with someone else. Many people are living in horrible conditions with bad landlords or alone. Some people have even been forced to move out. Many have even left in fear in order to go back to their own countries.
Honestly, with everything going on I never thought about returning to my country. Spain had been my home for over three years and I wasn't prepared to leave everything behind that suddenly. Also, it was advised -to not move. However, any hope of returning would have been short lived as my own country closed its borders on their citizens by March 22nd.It needed to be done to save the majority.

Things were collapsing everywhere.
Flights stopped.
Borders closed.
No leisure- no salsa dancing at the local discotecas, no eating out with friends, no more walks down my favourite area; MalasaÃ±a.
No parks.
No bowling.
No ski.

All at once the world stopped.

With the cases now at approximately 125,000 throughout Spain, things continue to look dim. Yet surprisingly, the solidarity of the Spanish continues to push through. Evenings of balcony gym sessions. Songs and smiles shared between neighbours. The videos that have been poured out on social media. The constant spread of encouragement and love. My second home remains resilient and hopeful of the day where we can stand freely in the sun once again.

And I am here for it.ðŸ’–
