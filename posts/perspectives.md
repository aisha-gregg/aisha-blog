I have always had so much curiosity dwelling inside me... So much pent up curiosity that I thought I would explode if I did not leave. I felt that I needed to learn about the world and had very much stereotyped different cultures and peoples based on my own upbringing and perspectives. And let’s not forget about what the media portrayed. Going abroad really opened a pleasant worldly vision for me. Back home, my country was known as being ‘diverse’ with a very significant Chinese, Indian and African mixed society. It actually seems slightly humourous now thinking about it. The truth is, I had never known true diversity without first living in a large European city. 

Once there, I was able to meet people from a handful of countries and backgrounds. I met Russians in my first month living in Spain who I previously stereotyped to be loud and rude but who were actually soft-spoken and kind. I met Europeans who couldn't care less about what you wore, your background or your lifestyle. I also met some who did, but they were the varied few. I encountered, learned and grew from people who originated from all walks of life. These people who were all chasing something bigger than themselves.

My perspectives are continuously being challenged and I welcome it. You grow so much by stepping in someone else’s shoes or getting into the same boat. It is a crazy realization that true connections and experiences through the eyes of your brother are what counts most.

**South Africa won my Heart**

The prospect of going to South Africa was daunting, and much scarier than when I moved to Germany. All I knew about South Africa was what I heard from others about Apartheid and the racial divides that still existed. And of course, because it was Africa, all I could picture were scenes of poverty and a place like an open jungle where I would be constantly running from lions and snakes and other carnivorous creatures. Those were the images painted on my mind by the media. So, in short, as I packed my suitcases, I thought that one way or the other, I would be maimed beyond recognition in South Africa.
Yet nothing was further from the truth. In South Africa, I was welcomed in several communities. I was embraced and  nurtured. For two years, whether the community was predominantly Black or White, I experienced love and respect. Of course my personal experiences do not negate the presence of racism in the country. There was plenty of evidence of that too. However, what I am saying is that I saw a willingness to heal from the past and embrace a future where people live and are treated as equal.

For as long as I can remember, I've loved languages and it's probably because I wanted to feel more connected to the world around me through stories. Growing up in a multicultural environment already helped plant the seed in my mind that many possibilities exist when it comes to leading a successful and fulfilling life - being able to travel and live abroad just deepened that understanding.

The thing that surprises me the most five years and four cities later is that even though we may come from very different countries, we are actually all so very connected in that we are having a very human experience of discovering who we are in a world that tries so hard to fit us into boxes. 

My experience living abroad has led me to build relationships with people from neighbouring islands in Barbados and Jamaica and even with people from places as far as Australia and Russia, yet still when we meet each other in a place that isn't our home we are kind of forced to reconnect with ourselves in a way that is vulnerable, honest, and authentic.

Travel opens up so many doors for you. In my case, through interacting with people from different walks of life, it has given me a unique perspective on being more comfortable exploring what makes me feel like myself and how to reconnect with self to live a more fulfilled and grounded life.

I went to an all-girls private school where I graduated with honors. I attended college and then went off to grad school. I moved to a big city and worked at a company that was the leader in my industry. By 30, I thought I knew a few things about life. Then I moved to New York City…

Pushed out of my comfort zone and into the concrete jungle, I settled into the somewhat familiar world of retail, but I was surrounded by a cast of characters vastly different from the cookie cutter world of Dallas. I worked with people who looked like me but who held wildly different values; those from farther parts of the country who grew up on their own; and from outside the US with multicultural backgrounds.

In hearing friends’ stories, I learned that they didn’t come to NYC to chase a dream, but rather, to escape a nightmare-because their community didn’t accept them for being gay. In working retail, I quickly realized that racism was a corporate policy, and that even though it didn’t feel right, lots of people (of many races) just went with it because they needed the job. In living in Manhattan, I watched as an entire vibrant city fell into a somber daze on the morning of November 9, 2016; and I felt the heaviness sit on the shoulders of people I loved for the next four years.

Over the years, coworkers and acquaintances turned into friends. One-off comments turned into deep discussions. My notion of fairness, justice, and freedom was turned on its head. Spending time in different neighborhoods, having late night conversations over wine, discussing politics in a group text, I learned to consider everything from a new perspective: one of curiosity, of empathy, of understanding. And now, across the ocean from JFK airport, I can feel the collective sigh of relief, the heaviness lifted, as the country spoke up in favor of a future with these things in mind.
Today, as I walk the hilly streets of Madrid, experiencing new people, cultures, foods, and traditions, I make sure to approach it all with a fresh set of eyes: with the open mind and open heart that NYC gave me.
