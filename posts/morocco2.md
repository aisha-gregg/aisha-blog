## Morocco (Marrakech and Chefchaouen)

Marrakech is unlike an other city that I have seen or visited. Its large redish pink walls rise around the city somehow protecting it from
the outside world. We arrived on a wet day with heavy rains that flooded our entrance to the main square. Yes, what a day to come to Marrakech.
It was chaotic scenery. Motorists stranded, people encircled by large pools of water, cars being pushed against the current of the floods.

Our driver circled for about forty minutes, not knowing exactly where to leave us as traffic police tried their best to maintain order. When the rain and flood waters finally began to subdue, our driver left us off ten minutes outside the square. We said goodbye to our friends from Seville and Greece and headed off to find our raid. Huddled under a tiny umbrella we tried to locate our place but we could not find a hotel sign. Suddenly a large group of kids approached us asking if we needed help.

We told them no, only to be followed with their excited cries for a chance at being rewarded for helping a tourist. A young man overhearing the commotion opened a large door and cautioned for us to come close asking if we were staying here at the raid. He pointed to the tiniest sign that you would have ever seen ( or never seen 😐) outside the apartment and we could finally breathe a sigh of relief. We were so tired from the drive from Mezouga to Marrakech and only desired sleep.

The man let us in. Inside was very beautiful with a small pool built in the center of the building.

After leaving our things in our room, we went down for dinner. It was the typical; tangine of potato, vegetables, olives and chicken. We were tired but excited to spend the entire next day venturing out into Marakkech. We had no idea what was in store for us...

The next morning we arose early to a surprisingly sunny hot day in the city (yesterday´s weather continues to be a mystery...).
After breakfast, we ventured out into the medina of the city filled with food, clothing, people and worst of all... MOTORISTS.

Seriously... Motorists are everywhere! Zooming and zinging past you as you walk the narrow streets of the medina. At first, it is something you try to get used to but perhaps being as tired as we were from a long drive through the Atlas mountains, left us (especially me) on edge. I couldn't really enjoy the city that much with the constant honking and traffic. The square of Marrakech has a lot of activity and people performing, selling things and doing tricks for money.

Here is where you must be careful as a lot of people will try to scam you! A guy with snakes insisted on taking our photos and then wanted to charge us about 40 euros for them. We politely refused and offered him a lower amount. 1 euro is around 10 morrocan dirham. So the performer wanted to charge us over 400 dirham. It is worth mentioning that salaries there are quite low so it is good to bear this in mind as people are desperately trying to meet expenses.

In fact, a lot of what we saw in Morocco was unfortunately young children and older people begging in the streets. It was heartbreaking to have a little kid following you around asking for food. It's so important to be aware of the poverty there and if you are planning to go, mentally prepare yourself for the shocks you will most certainly experience.

After a day out in Marrakech we returned to our raid for a dip in our pool and to prepare to catch our flight to Tetuan the next day. We decided that we would actually save money by walking from the centre of Marrakech to the airport instead of getting a cab which is around 150 dirham.

**DON'T. DO. IT.**

The walk was painstakingly long, around an hour and a half and they purposely built the airport with the entrance facing away from the city. So we had to walk miles from the back of the airport walls to the front entrance which was ridiculous! Because the airport is large and stretches across the compound we were unaware that the entrance would be on the other side of the outskirts of the city. Catch a cab don't fight to catch your breath, sis 😥. Swear we almost missed our flight and all! Lol.

But once we were there, we calmly boarded our flight with AirArabia —which was super comfortable I must say—.

**We were off to Tetuan!**

Beautiful Tetuan is more of an european picture within an arabic city. Large white apartments, large streets and a lot of people. When we arrived Ramadan was to be celebrated the following day and... Well, let's just say we were glad to be leaving in two days. Everything would be closed and moving around would have been difficult.

If you are looking for a budget friendly hotel in the area for just a couple days Ibis hotel is your option. We were driven there by a driver who spoke both french and spanish. As Tetuan is in the north of Morocco, and because of the Spanish conquest in the 1920's you will find that many people also speak the latin language. We talked with him about the option of visiting Chefchaouen for a day trip and told him we would contact him in the morning for him to pick us up. The cost for the day trip was around 40 euros.

So let's get right down to it!

Chefchaouen which is located about an hour and a half from Tetuan is known famously as the blue city or blue pearl. Its beautiful blue buildings are painted in a mineral paint that is said to keep mosquitos away but curiously it was also known as a safe haven for Jews and Moors during the Spanish reconquest as the colour blue is said to depict "heaven" or "the sky".

The views of the city are simply refreshing. On a sunny day the light reflects brilliantly off the white and blue houses and shops. There is a small river that flows through the valley where many people go to refresh themselves from the heat. And I should also mention that there are **fricken peacocks**!

## Top things to do in Chefchaouen

1. **Kasbah Tower and Museum:** Learn about the history of the city and explore the building enjoying the scenic views.

2. **Visit the shops and bazaars:** In one of the stores we were able to get moroccan oils which smell heavenly and really moisterize the skin. Many of these stores sell them.

3. **Eat in one of the restaurants** in the main plaza which overlooks the city shops and hills.

4. **Vist the flower pot wall.** I think most pictures of the city are taken here lol.

Most importantly get lost in the peaceful magic that is Chefchaouen! I would definitely recommend it if you have the time. Furthermore, there are many more activities you can do like hiking, getting a moroccan massage or even visiting the National Park and Akchour waterfall, which unfortunately we did not have time to do.

We headed back before sunset to our Ibis hotel content and satisfied with our day and in extension our trip. Morocco is filled with varying culture, moods, vibes and colour. It is also shocking, heartbreaking and interesting.

Already cannot wait to return one day. I've heard Casablanca is awesome. Let me know about your experiences in Morocco down below!

Until the next trip, Morocco.💙
