## Dear Madrid - Posted on the 15th of June, 2020

To the city that welcomed me,

there's no way to possibly express, the things that I have learnt, the things in which I have felt,
in your arms. I have learnt to love in another way,
to see, to cry, to grow, didn't matter the day.

When the sun chose to rose,
I rose with it.
I rose with you.

Admiring your buildings of architectural splendor, the crowds, the center; Sol, Opera, Tirso de molina, Atocha, Retiro... such beauty under a sea of blue.
I partook in your life's offering regardless of the suffering I had to endure.
No place to stay, horrible landlords, no money, no one I knew.
Sleeping in parks, beneath the dawn's dew.

At first, there was an extreme challenge of befriending your own, as if they were _my own_,
but they truly already had _their own_, however, at the end, still meetiing so many that I could easily reach out to.
Coming across people from countless countries, it was crazy in the beginning; the boiling pot of diversity, yet being black, I did always stand out.

No matter though.

I was able to learn to use another tongue other than my own!
Fumbling at first, still at many times doing so, but it is slowing becoming a part of me, a part of my identity, thanks to you.
Crazy to think, another part of me has evolved.
For, to be able to understand other languages; now perspective is immensely involved.

You boast of so much to see and do, from your attractive parks, bars, clubs, social activities, sports and malls to meetups with the people who live everyday within your walls.

From your terraces that kiss your cloudless skies, to the green sub-urban areas where larger and wealthier families reside. The shock of seeing a sea of flats and how people lived, confused me at first, but it is part of your culture, a tradition, families and friends close enough, quenching those thirsts... of love.

From your narrow cobbled-stoned roads that led me a million times home, to the underground tube which I rode for the first time in the summer month of June. Corners filled with dancers and instumentalists floading the city with music and noise. To the cries of anguish or joy after every football match of Real Madrid.

From the beautiful (very) hot summers, the hiking, the biking, the rooftops, the poolside, the picnics in July, to those winter nights trying to stay warm under a blanket... almost crying.

From the hurt people imposed on me, the discrimination against me, to the smiles of the waiters, the store clerks, the teachers. To the amount of people generally warm to a stranger like me...

From an anxious super-dependent girl, to an anxious independent traveller. One who can hold her own, be courageous in the face of adversity, communicate in Spanish, empathize with other immigrants and appreciate those from different walks of life.

To all this and more, I say...

Thank you, Madrid.

You will always be my home away from home.

Until the end.
