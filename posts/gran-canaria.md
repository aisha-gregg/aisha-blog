## Gran Canaria - Posted on the 8th of August, 2020

The Canary islands of Spain include 7 main islands, one of which I was fortunate to visit this year. The islands themself have different querks about them that make them stand out from one another yet providing that intimate island life that we all seek from time to time. This time I got to visit Gran Canaria. If you look at it on the map it is almost shaped like a perfect circle. Despite from this little feature, it is interesting to note that the island from north to south regions transmit totally polar opposite views and vibes. The south, which was the region where we stayed at, was dry, rocky and brown. In fact, on exiting the airport and heading unto the main motorway I felt as if I was transported to Mars. At least that or that a tornado blew through the region. There were flat terrains of muddy, sandy and bricky stone that you could see for miles on end, rising at some mountainous peaks only to be adorned by their large white windmills, giving some certainty of life. I was **SHOCKED.**

"What blasphemy was this?" This was an island? It was super dry, much worse than what I **EVER** saw in Spain, and super deserted. I could not believe it.

_But wait._

Fortunately, it got better.

We got to the area of San Agust√≠n which is highly talked about as being a popular area for tourists. This is because there is a large selection of beaches to choose from, a couple malls, mini golf, many restaurants and even a main strip close to the Maspalomas beach where you could have a few social drinks. This area was relatively 'greener' than what you can see exiting the airport, lined with many palm trees and cute apartments and beach houses. It is also surprising how many nationalities you can find there on holiday from Germany, and Switzerland. Many signs and menus were in three main languages: German, Spanish and English.

Around the Maspalomas area you can find huge _dunes_ ( yep, I said dunes!) which sit right next to the beach! You can basically take a surfboard there and do a bit of sandsurfing! They seem almost imaginary as their white sands shimmer below the blazing sun and even more so as you begin to rise and sink with them. Just ten mintuues away you can find _'English Beach'_ which is a nudist beach. An interesting experience as I have never been to one and well it brought up many interesting points about desensitizing nudity. I, myself did not partake but let's see what the future holds!ü§£

Other than the dunes, the main things to see in the southern part of the island were the beaches and the town of **Mog√°n**, which is a tourist gem. A tiny town that sits on the beach lined with restaurants and shops, it is called the Venice of the Canary islands. It displays a beautiful mix of both Venician and greek touches, with white houses and canals which seem to chase you through the town. The town and Venecian area is quite small though - nothing like the size of Venice - yet maybe that's what makes it special.‚ù§Ô∏è The beach there is also very nice, blue and calm with many family-friendly events, kayaking, paddle boats and floats for rent.

Other very nice beaches in the south includes Amadores beach and Puerto Rico beach which are a must visit. The beaches there are lovely. Blue waters and clear sands. We spent many days just beach hopping, and it was defintely all I needed.

That is until we went to the north.

The north as I mentioned earlier, was **SO** different. It is more mountainous.
Green and lined with plants and trees galore. **Beautiful!**

There are some things to do there also, such as hiking or wine tasting. We decided on a whim to go to a vineyard and wine tasting. It was the first time I experienced it and I would defintely recommend it. You meet people and support a local business. You can also learn a lot about the island not only about how wine is made. Like did you know the Canary islands got their name from the word '_Canine_' and is adorned with statues of dogs?

The north of the island is also cooler. We went to the city center, Las Palmas, which was overcast and windy but a welcomed protection from the sun that blazed in the south. There in the city you can see a more vibrant life, filled with people, buildings and a few monuments. You can also find an **amazing** beach called **Las Canteras** which has its own coral reef. In fact, snorkeling is very common there and the species of fish to be discovered there can seem endless!

All in all, Gran Canaria is a curious mix of beach, mountain, stone, city and plains. It has a little bit of everything for everyone.

Just like the locals say *"Gran Canaria is a little continent on its own"*üôÇ

So...

Who else can't wait to discover it? üòè
