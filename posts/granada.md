## Granada - Posted on the 24th of May, 2020

When they mention the snowy mountains of the Sierra Nevada, the amazing tapas, the gorgeous weather and the beautiful Alhambra‚Ä¶ you know that they are talking about one of the most picturesque cities in Spain: Granada.

On arriving to this city for the first time anyone can see why it is as impressive as they claim. The first thing you see is the extensive mountain range of the Sierra Nevada which is very popular during the winter months of November to March for skiing. Even in the months of May you can still find them pristine and glistening with snow.

My first visit was during the month of November. I had only been living in Madrid for about five months at the time but the comparisons between this little Andalusian gem and the capital city immediately stood out. Granada has a certain moroccan look and feel, it is quieter and very walkable. The food is also cheaper and pretty amazing! It is the only Andalusian city I have visited which has such a large selection of delicious tapas. Granada is definitely a lot hillier and greener also. You will for sure work those legs visiting neighbouring Albaic√≠n ‚Äî a medieval arab town known for its white walls and spanish-style rooftops that sits 700 meters above sea level ‚Äî but seeing its beauty will be so worth it.

Visiting the Alhambra is no walk in the park either but an absolute must! The Alhambra has actually gotten a lot of recognition since then US president Bill Clinton visited and gushed about its beautiful sunsets, even returning with his own family as he promised himself he would. He claimed that the sunsets were the same as the old days, engulfing the city in beautiful violet hues.

If you go today, you can surely experience these magical sunsets, after spending an entire day visiting the palace of Nazaries and the general life gardens.
There is no other serenity that I have known that emanates from the Alhambra and its numerous courtyards and gardens. The views, which you can also find at the 'Mirador of San Nicolas' are too, to die for.

Granada has actually become a popular spot among visitors and students alike and offers a variety of things to do even in the centre of the city.

You can :

_1. Take segway tours._

This has become a popular mode of transport in many European cities and provides a unique way of getting around the city. The tours usually start around 30 euros for an hour to two hour guided tour. I've heard it is actually fun, although I have never actually tried these myself!üòè

_2. Visit the cathedral of Granada or the Basilica of San Juan._

If you are interested in cathedrals you can also visit these two impressive buildings which showcase their baroque style and provides audio tours of many features inside, including artwork and other historical aspects.

_3. The historic centre._

Moving around the centre of Granada, you will find an abundance of Moorish influence and stores filled with Moroccan-style decor, lamps, clothing and even food typical of the region. It is almost as if you have been transported to Morocco! Truly the mix of these two cultures ‚Äî Spanish and Moor ‚Äî radiates throughout this beautiful city.

_4. Flamenco show, anyone?_

As Granada becomes more popular, a taste of Spanish culture shines through with the various flamenco shows you can find here. Granada is the perfect place to experience a budget-friendly flamenco show which showcases the true Andalusian form of dance and song.

_5. Spa day._

Granada actually has a decent selection of budget-friendly spas located across the city. Take a break from the heat and submerge yourself in a relaxing pool. Most spas, such as the one I visited which was called 'Ba√±os de Elvira', include massages as well as complementary water, tea and fruit.

Now, you can also take hikes to the mountains during the spring to autumn months. During winter, however, it is the perfect location for skiing. If you are adventurous enough, that is.üòâ But whatever you choose to do, you can find it all.

Granada with its cute neighbourhoods and attractions just seems to check all the boxes. To this date, I have visited three times and it remains without a doubt one of my favourite cities in Spain.üíñ
