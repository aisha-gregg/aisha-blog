## Perfect Prague

So you would like to visit Prague?
And yes, of course I mean when everything is safe again and we can all go back to living our travel adventures! If so, then you have made an amazing choice which will become an unforgettable
memory. And if you are unsure, then you are in luck because I am here to convince you that you will not -for one moment -regret embarking on a trip such as this one. And here is why:

Prague is a country surrounded by sea, mountainous lands and beautiful cobble-stoned streets. The coastline boasts of beautiful stone bridges that connect various neighbourhoods. It is a breathtaking city which is world renowned for its local made beer, jaw-dropping architecture, sea and of course its streets lined with shops.

In fact, Prague was a part of a solo trip I did in 2019 and I would definitely recommend this safe city to other female solo travellers.

So what else makes Prague so special?

Let's dive right in to find out.

1. **San Vito Cathedral**

In visiting the largest temple in Prague you will come to find that it is is adorned with its gothic like finishes and is a main site for visitors. It actually has a very interesting history as its construction had to be terminated due to the Bohemian wars, which occurred during the 14th century. The cathedral survived and is now a historical emblem documenting history. Tourists can access the cathedral along with a circuit ticket which allows you to visit other castles and or temples. The cost is around 10 euros. It is one of the original features of this unique city but moving onwards into the new town we can come acroos sppledid architectural works of art.

2. **Dancing House**

The dancing house which is also known as the Fred and Ginger due to its appearance of two dancers was designed by a croatian architect and completed in 1996. It is known, or was known rather, as quite controversial due to its modern flare, as many buildings in Prague followed gothic like influences and the city itself grew to be famous due to this specific type of architecture. It definitely stands out so much so that catching a peep at it would not cost you a thing!

3. **The Astronomical Clock**

The clock is located in the old town hall in the most beautiful square I have seen in Europe thus far. It was built in 1410 and then after statues and other touches were placed around to adorn the clock. Internally one can see the astronomical dials which paint the Sun, Sky and the Earth. It is truly a sight to be seen, even more so being one of the top five most impressive astronomical clocks in the world today.

4. **National Theatre House**

If you are into thearte arts, plays and music you must pay a visit to this incredible house which has managed to mold the cultural, and linguistic aspects of the Czech people. They feature shows especially ballet and opera throughtout the year, however prices are pretty high especially if you by last minute. They usually range from around 370 euros upwards! But hey, you can always admire the building from the outside. Prague also has two other opera houses which offer simmilar shows and prices.

5. **Prague Castle**

Let's talk about the castle of Prague! This beauty stands among the city's glorious mountains and was built all the way back in the 9th century! Even crazier is that this castle is said to be the largest castle in the world for its age, attracting curious tourists all around the world - almost 2 million a year! ( Well, except for 2020, of course) The castle maintains much of its gothic aspects and now serves as the presidential office and residence. Outside the castle there are brilliant gardens in which you can gaze.

6. **Charles Bridge**

So many people know about this bridge because of the legend, stories and statues attached to it. It is iconic dating back to the times of when the city was the capital of Bohemia. Adorned with statues of Christ as well as the priest John who was thrown into the river and then praised and tributed to for his honesty, it reveals so much amazing and intense history as you walk across the river, the lights of the city reflecting on the water. The most famous legend is that of touching the staue Saint John. This is said to bring you good fortune in your future.

7. **Old town Square**

I had mentioned earlier that the town square was the most beautiful square in Europe. In my opinion, anyways. But it is absolutely refreshing the stone-cobbled grounds and streets, the colourful buildings, the flowers dancing off the tiny terraces, the fountains, the astronomical clock tucked away neatly into the wall of the town hall _and_ the restaurants that swoon around it. It is huge and just full of life. I was in love. I would highly recommend staying in this area! Hotels and apartments around the old town square usually range from around 50 a night. And it is most likely worth it.

Now besides these monuments and must-sees there are some surprising facts about Prague that must be shared.

1. Prague is one of the few countries in the European Union that uses its own currency. However, they will still take euros, particularly in the form of notes. They are not very keen on the coins.

2. The beer in Prague is pretty great although I am not too much of a beer person myself. But the beer brewed in Prague is world famous, very affordable and deserves a taste if you are a beer lover.

3. Prague is an extremely romantic city so, beware, you probably do not want to solo travel there and be surrounded by couples every where you turn. I had not known this before I went on my solo trip in 2019 and felt a bit of the odd one out.

But you know what, I still enjoyed the city regardless with my lonesome self! ðŸ˜†

So have you visited Prague? If not, what are you waiting for? :)
