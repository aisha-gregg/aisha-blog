## Seville - Posted on the 27th of June, 2020

There is a magic that belongs to Seville, Spain. It is a cute southern city in Andalusia that is very popular among tourists, students and even nationals.
It is a five hour drive from the capital of Spain and it is located very close to the Andalusian city of Córdoba. In Seville, you can encounter a lot of moor influence, especially in the kind of food you will come across. The food is incredibly delicious featuring plates from various countries: Africa, Greece and even Turkey.
I ate the very typical Moroccan dish of cous cous with chicken, and was also lucky to find a couple of lovely restaurants specializing in turkish cuisine, in particular, falafel, salads and kebabs.

I highly recommend [Mechela Bailén](https://mechelarestaurante.es/): a small restaurant that I visited which served amazing Spanish food which included arroz negro (rice in squid ink), coucous with almonds, and other tasty mediterranean meals, exceptional value for such a budget-friendly cost! You can also explore other highly rated restaurants close by which include the Cocome and La Pajarita.

Seville, is quite walkable but also well-communicated by a tram system that runs through the centre of the city. You can also hear the clicking of horses as they trot through the city streets. People sometimes opt to take the horse rides through the city and crazily enough there may actually be more horses than cars!

Furthermore, the lovely city boasts of some large parks and squares where you can relax or take in even more views of some of the beautiful buildings found around you. The most captivating and talked about square is the **Plaza de España of Seville** which is found inside the Maria Luisa Park. It is absolutely captivating. It is without a doubt the most beautiful square in Spain. It is a Renaissance/ Moor styled work of art which features a canal that runs alongside it. Within the walls of the building you can find ceramic tiles and benches dedicated to the 48 provinces of Spain.

Dedicated Star Wars fans also know of this promising site as the movie's filming location. But there are also other suprising locations in Seville which include **the Royal Alcázar**; a UNESCO world heritage site, which was also featured in Game of Thrones! The gardens within this site make up hundreds of acres of vivid greenery and even feature a peacock or two!

Moving out of the Alcazár you can easily come across **the cathedral of Seville**, where you are most certain to see a wedding or two taking place. They say Seville is one of the best and most romantic cities to get married. I believed it after staying for three days and seeing a wedding or wedding party almost the entire time.

In the city, the **'Setas de Sevilla' aka the Metropol Parasol** is the strangest and most unique piece of architecture you will see rising above the city which will cost you about 3 euros to go up. When you do you get pretty decent views of the city. Seville is not a very vertical city so the buildings are all in plain view from the Parasol. After visiting the Setas however, you can take a walk to the Isabel II bridge that connects Seville with the city of Triana, a part of the city which is said to have a very hip neighbourhood, good food and an interesting history.

Close by you also have parks where you can relax and watch the sunlight reflect off the water, while small boats go pass on the canal. Interestingly, Seville has about ten bridges which connects to various Sevillan neighbourhoods, providing for easy and reliable connection to the city.

One of my favourite parts of Seville was definitely the strip near Alameda and Rey Juan Carlos street which was lined with bars, restaurants and such a lively vibe and fun night atmosphere that reminded me of similar party strips that I have visited in the past or seen in Trinidad. With the sea reflecting under the night's moon, I spent my last night in Seville meeting up with a Spanish classmate who was leaving Spain for the last time to return home permanently. We had a drink and departed, going our separate ways...

For her, her life back in the states while I would head back to the capital city of Madrid. But with a definite impression of this romantic little treasure called Seville.
