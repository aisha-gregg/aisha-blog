                <p class="p1"><strong>As the sensation of summer lingers once more.</strong><br>
                my thoughts wonder back to when my eyes first appreciated your splendor <br>
                the multitudes of buildings that encircled me, that should have left me with a feeling of   <br>
               claustrobia yet only gave me as many spaniards say ¨illusion¨ <br>I
            will always remember that feeling of nostalgia every year,that of the very first year, the warmth of the dry wind before it caressed my nose <br>
           the heat before it burned through my pair of tight blue jeans, and how the summer air can stifle. <br>Like the first summer it is a period of reflection, the closing
           of a chapter and the hopeful longing of something more, something distinct and new that can tie me here to 
           your vibrant city.I have become aclimitized if not physically mentally by your heat and 
           it does not deter me from appreciating you.
           Yet, the feeling of uncertainty remains, where do I go? What should I do? Has the time come
           to move on? My seond summer I was not prepared to leave you, I wanted more of this freedom , the freedom I only found with you.That I knew with you.
           I wanted to explore more, so I stayed.The third summer came spiraling and I found myself wanting to leave,
           I thought now I need to appreciate another city, in a profession where I usually feel underapreciated.
           I wanted to go to Barcelona.Forgive me Madrid, but I really wish to be close to the water or a coast.Yet, you put things in place
           to see that that did not happen. I have not complained, it was the right choice.However, the yearning to escape you, if only for a year has not lifted.
           The curiousity has not been subdued...and as this fourth summer rolls on, the usual confusion sets in once more.
